pos,"Stash is a great place to go for some shopping if you are really willing to shell out the big bucks on basically jeans and tees. Going in for one item is okay, but try walking out with a few more items than that and you could look at a receipt for over a thusand dollars! I personally like to just look, get my shopping fix for the day, and bolt out before I find my wallet that I was probably digging for since walking through the door. Hey, my purse is like an old lady's carpet bag, but it helps save me dough since I can never find my cards!"
neu,"Average burger place for what I expected.  Nice to be able to pick your toppings.  Not the best burger I've had by a long shot.  Pricey, but not more than all the restaurants are in Vegas.  Went there late in the evening after the Jimmy Buffet concert....for some reason I was wanting a cheeseburger.  :-)

Had the Kobe burger with portobellos and blue cheese.  Tasty but didn't knock my socks off.  The sweet potato fries were okay, not the best I've tasted.  The fried zucchini was AWESOME though.  Just get them as your side instead of the sweet potato or regular fries...trust me.  Didn't have a shake or anything, but they did have a nice beer list and I enjoyed the Shiner Bock on tap.

The waitress wasn't very attentive. 

Overall I probably wouldn't go back because I could get just as good if not better somewhere else.  I will add that when I was at Bobby Flay's restaurant for brunch that day (Mesa Grill at Caesars Palace) they were bringing out some of their burgers that people ordered and they looked really tasty.  Might have to try one next time I go back to Lost Wages...er...I mean Las Vegas."
neg,"I'm going to be really harsh with my stars since this is Vegas but COME ON, this is LAS VEGAS and the MIRAGE, the MIRAGE IS NOT GHETTO and this place is... ghetto compared to the plethora of clubs in vegas.  Aside from Jet being small and the dance floor being impossible to move through, and the decor to be lacking, the security guards and everyone who was working for this place was an asshole (except for one of the gogo dancers).  We had a promoter escort us into the club and one of the bitches in charge named Joanna gave us the worst attitude ever. She actually snapped her fingers in my friend's face and yelled at her to ""FOCUS."" WHO DOES THAT? We weren't being obnoxious, we weren't drunk off our asses, we were a little intoxicated but we were just standing there waiting for them to bring us in.  Not only that but when we were inside the club, the security guards were ridiculously and unnecessarily pushy and mean and they kept kicking us out of the area outside of the bathroom.  We moved to the bar where other people were drinking and they still made us move just because we were still waiting for our friend in the bathroom. wtf.  Hell no, I'm not coming back."
neu,"Oh, if only THE Gordon of Gordon Biersch could see this location....

I think he would frown on the lack of garlic fries on the menu. All the GB classic plates are replaced with.... SANDWICHES? Who's restaurant is this? My frat boy brother's??? Seriously, sandwiches and beer makes me pretty much.... Drunk. Ordered a wich and a brew, and then complimented the sub-par food with a trip down to Chili's Too (ALSO in D terminal). 

Boo hiss. Three stars for the Martzen."
neu,"This is a contender for the diviest bar in this section of Old Town. It is a toss up between here and Gilligan's, imho. DJ's is much less intentionally trashy, whereas Gilligan's tries to pull off ""trashy-chic"" so score some extra points for it in that regard. For whatever reason, I kinda like that about it. 

It also has one of the highest probabilities of showcasing a good old fashioned bar fight. For whatever reason, I've seen more fights here than anywhere else in town (this place nudges out Loco Patron). 

The drinks here are stiff and the staff doesn't mess around. They are serious about keeping you in line and as wasted as you should be on a given night. 

So if you're thinking about getting rowdy, this might be a good place to start. Just don't be surprised if you get tossed out for being a little too ambitious with your intentions."
pos,"The theater, like the mall, is lovely and upscale. They have 20 screens so chances are, you could just show up and find something that appeals to you. Another plus is the snack bar. While we don't usually take advantage of it -- I go the M&M's and licorace in my purse route-- it does have an A+ selection if you're into that kind of thing. 

The seats are large, have head rests, and recline. They are spaced every-other-one so you don't have to look at the back of someone's head through the whole movie. A big bonus for kids or shorties like me. 

One more thing: They offer childcare. For $7 the kid gets to safely play while you watch an R rated movie. What a concept!"
pos,"I will give this food store 5 starts not because they have neat shelves filled with mostly the same product you can find at any big supermarket  but because it's the only place where I buy meat and fish. I have 4 big stores in a 2 mile radius  but  I spend extra 15 minutes to drive to AJ's Fine Foods. I'm so glad I found out about this chain as they have the best selection of seafood and meat in Chandler + it's always fresh. It's not cheap though, but I'm willing to pay extra and enjoy my dinner instead of opening a package and wondering why it smells funny...

Note: How do you know if the meat you buy is fresh? Smell it, it should not smell at all. Same about fish - it should not smell fishy, oh no!"
neu,"Dude, I clearly need to make friends with some people on here!  It was an acceptable choice for the weekend, though sharing a double bed isn't all that great (why no queens?).  It was clear from the design of the room that the possibility of four women sharing it was not contemplated.  The makeup light in the bathroom (which was tiny!) highlighted every flaw, there wasn't a full-length mirror, and it was almost impossible to blow-dry one's hair using the other (tiny) mirror in the actual room.  Seems like I might be the only one with this problem, though!  The pool area is nice and spacious, lots of chairs were available at different times and there were plenty of shady options for those of us with fair skin.

So if someone here wants to hook me up for next time, I'd be more than happy to update my review!"
pos,"This place is pretty yums and the prices are great! I got a sirloin cheesburger with fries for $11.. In Vegas, in the Mandelay Bay? That's great, don't-cha think? It was really good too. The service wasn't phenomenal, but it was good. I got a refill without asking for it and he was nice.
It was open pretty late too.. I think we got there around 11-ish? 
I was happy..:)"
neg,"My girlfriend's favorite restaurant is Red Lobster.  

(Can I get some sympathy?)

Since this location is near my mom, and near where we used to live, I've been there a lot.  Yea, I like their biscuits.  And the food isn't particularly bad or anything.  But DANG it's gotten expensive for what you're getting.  And the lines at this particular location can be insane!  We've had an hour's wait before.  An HOUR wait.  For Red Lobster!  Sigh....   I will say that we had a good experience not too long ago.  We went to the bar, as the wait was long.  We found out that we could order directly at the bar.  The bartender was our best server in a long time at that location.  And of course, we never had to wait long for a drink refill.  If you're thinking about going I suggest you sit in the bar.  

This will never be a place I suggest between the long waits and value for what you are and aren't getting.  But... she loves the Ultimate Feast and nothing will ever change that.  So I'm sure we'll end up going again...."
neg,"Don't stay here. It's gross. They turn the AC off during the week. There are creepy people everywhere. And most importantly, it doesn't feel too safe (if you're a woman). 

The casino is good for people-watching though. There are lots of interesting characters around, and many of the casino workers are dressed in costume, impersonating celebrities (Michael Jackson, Madonna, Whitney, Joan Jett, etc.)  

The Imperial Palace is trashy, not classy. You'll wish you had stayed somewhere else."
neg,"To be perfectly honest, Hubby and I went here because we wanted to check out  the cool building. And we like Sweet Tomatoes well enough, so we braved it in spite of some mediocre reviews. Let's just say I wasn't sure how fresh the lettuce was and if the cheese was real. No refills on drinks were offered while we were there. The selection was similar to Sweet Tomatoes, but lower quality. The soups didn't look great, so neither of us tried one- and they were different from what the website said they would be. The breads were ok, with the stand-out being the clearly from a mix cheesy drop-biscuit. Kinda sad. The pasta sauces looked off-color and the pizza appeared underdone and topped with cheap (again- real???) cheese. The desserts were alright- Hubby liked his non-dairy iced product in a cone well enough and I actually rather liked my strawberry shortcake. The inside of the building was not as cool as the outside, with some scary dust and water damaged panels in parts of the multi-layered ceiling. We asked the hostess what it had been before  and she said it had been a bank in the 70's. I managed to stop myself from quipping, ""Well you can bank on us not returning."""
neg,"found a hair in my food.
maybe a hairnet or two might help.
The outdoor seating is really sidewalk seating next to the parking lot and cars.
Would vote lower if the option were available."
neu,"decent food-   prices are reasonable considering you are at a 4 star hotel.  The quantities are huge.  I recommend the beef pho, side salad-

My service was good-  the waiter was attentive.

this is a 24 hour cafe so my expectations are not huge."
pos,"This place is a nice place to go for brunch, especially with a group - they're very accomodating even at the last minute.  Pretty view of the golf course from inside.  Atmosphere is a little rough around the edges, but the place is well loved.  The staff make you feel like family and the food always comes out fast.  The food is mediocre - never had anything there that was gourmet, but you can get a decent meal in a nice spot.  They do weddings and receptions and the pretty golf course scenery makes it a fine spot for a special occassion."
pos,I bought two bikes there last year.  Price and service terrific.
pos,"This was my 1st time using US Airways, which has joined forces with America West.  I have no real complaints here.  Check-in is simple with their kiosks.  Assigned seating is a standard.  Drinks and pretzels provided in flight, even if it's an hour flight.  I'd fly with them again."
neg,"First, let me say that Italian eateries appear to be a dime a dozen. ""Italian"" has become watered down into a bland mix of spaghetti, lasagna, pizzas and some bland salads on iceberg lettuce.  I got tired of these so-called Italian restaurants eons ago.  But someone suggested Fazoli's so I tried it. YUCK!  It fits right in with the bland, pseudo-Italian stuff I've been talking about. Does that mean the food is bad? Not necessarily, but you can see from my review my basis for judging it unsatisfying. It's just kinda nondescript, nonspecial, ""blah"" to me.   But that type of blandness could make it a good choice for a group of friends or a family with kids who want a casual dinner with familiar foods."
neu,"Try the curry chips.  They are the best I've had & try them at every Irish Pub I go to.

The beer is tasty & if it's not too hot outside, the patio is great."
neg,"If you don't like seafood do not come here! They only have a few other choices and the day I was there they were even out of what I wanted...I just think that's crappy and the waiter should tell you before you decide on your meal. I was really disappointed. 

I had to eat an appetizer for dinner (the risotto) because there wasn't anything else. It was okay...I split it with a friend...I think it was $14 and then they made us pay a $5 split charge and didn't tell us!! We would have ordered two things if we knew the charge was going to be 1/3 of our meal.

Just watch out! I was really disappointed! There are soooo many other fabulous place to eat in Vegas!"
pos,"This is a terrific homewares store!  Great selections of many categories of merchandise.  It ain't cheap, but it's all *quality* stuff. 

Most of the people are knowledgeable & happily helpful.

Almost everything I've bought here is completely satisfying.  On a rare occasion I've taken something back -- they simply replaced it or refunded my money.  No big deal about it.

Whenever I need something along their line, BB&B is where I go first.   Then I don't have to go anywhere else second."
pos,"Asking yourself ""what is the point of this magazine"" is like trying to find meaning in a Pauly Shore movie.  

There is no point!  Just sit back, relax, and allow yourself to be entertained.  Are you really expecting any sort of intellectual stimulation out of this magazine?  

944 Magazine is the perfect reading material when you're sitting on the toilet pushing one out.  You can go cover to cover in the 5-10 minutes you're on the john, laugh hysterically at points, get depressed over the future of society at other points, and otherwise keep yourself entertained.  And a bonus is that every once in a while you might find an event or new restaurant opening that piques your interest.  

And in the end, it's great for squishing scorpions.

Not to mention IT'S TOTALLY FREE.  I guess if you paid money for it, I can understand a little resentment.  But for a free throw-away?  Give me a break.

944 serves it's purpose perfectly."
neu,"I went here in the mid 90's so don't know what it's like now, but from what I remember, it was a fun little pseudo ghost town and worth the 45 trip out from Vegas to see it."
neu,"This was my third time here and first eating at the bar.  The bar area is awesome, granite table top, good wine selection, lots of comfy seating, and a big bathroom right off of the bar with real towels.  There is enough seating at the bar for about 9 and other bar seating hightops and couches for about 15.  It's an intimate bar.  It also has a seperate entrance than the restaurant fyi, Ziggy is the headbartender and is really good, a true pro, the others like Joe are just 20 somethings figuring it out.  Unfortuantely, Ziggy wasn't at the bar most of the time and I found myself asking for refills instead of being asked, not good.  Most of the folks at the bar are like me, guys in ties by themselves who want better than hotel food.  We ordered three appetizers that were all four star quality, but really pricey.  I ordered the filet on filet, which was a carpaccio and tartare of prime filet, served with a quail egg and a nice garlic aoili (sp?), as good as any in the city.  Steven ordered the lobster mac, which was better than most and you could actually taste chunks of lobster as well as the short rib.  The short rib was cooked perfectly, moist, rich delicious.  These apps were around $13 each which is I guess okay, even though portions are tiny.  However, a big miss on the entrees.  I ordered the elysian fields lamb, which was undercooked, and maybe a 2oz portion (FOR $42!!, WTF!).  It was served with a ice cold puree of something indistinguishable and maybe two baby onions.  This totally could have been just an appetizer portion and not a very good one at that, disappointing.  Steven ordered the filet, which was a reasonable size (4 oz. I'd guess) for $34 with a few potatoes.  It was good, but not memorable.  Overall this place probably deserves 2.5 stars.  I should have stopped after the apps'.  I didn't pay, so I'm not sure if the wine was pricey, but if it was anything like the tiny overpriced entrees' I'm sure it was."
neu,"I gave this restaurant an extra star for the view of the canal. You do the math. I just find it overpriced. The ingredients were fresh and the food was good but even in Vegas I think this restaurant was too full of themselves. When the waiter talks about the restaurant's history more than the food you know you are in trouble.

I had a seafood pasta that was traditional and cooked perfectly, but I could've cooked it perfectly. There was nothing unique about it. The sauce could've been out of a can for all I know. Just didn't stand out. The Chicken parm was good but someone's arm hurts in the kitchen because the chicken was so flat that you almost couldn't tell if it was veal or chicken, I guess this isn't a terrible thing. Just not traditional in my opinion (I also think I make the best chicken parm in the world). Anyways, i give the desserts 5 stars. Their pastry chef is working hard back there and the chocolate and little fancy truffles and whatevers were melt in your mouth delicious. The desserts made the meal enjoyable.

What was not enjoyable, however, was the bill. Way over priced for regular old Italian food! Even for Vegas. The staff was great and they worked there ass off trying to make up for the high price tag."
neu,"Grabbed some tacos on the way to my class today, after work. 2 fish tacos, 1 spicy chicken and 1 tea. Iced tea was disgusting and i told them so, they agreed and actually dumped all of their remaining tea out. I have gotten no apology, but did get a refill with watered down Horchata. 
Tacos were alright. Nothing really to write home about. Just average good taco. Does not qualify for a big deal in my book.
Stop by there or keep driving is totally up to you. If i were in your car i would have said - ""Whatever""."
neu,"The pizza is great!  I can't really say what makes it so good but its really satisfying when you want something more than greasy cardboard with rubber cheese.  Definitely the best pizza downtown.
As for a bar, Map Room is great when you are hanging out with a fun group of friends and just want a place to hang out.  Map Room is almost perfectly lacking in any real atmosphere or personality - its just a good space to hang out with your friends and grab a beer."
neg,"if i was realllllllllllly craving korean food, and this was the onnnnnnnnnnnnly place open, and i was riiiiiiiiiiiiiiight there, i'd eat here again. 
otherwise, i'd pass, and go somewhere else (like, 7th st and bell).

the food isn't atrocious, it's just not THAT great, especially since the prices aren't anything special. it's nice for a quick fix. haven't tried the chinese food, but since the owners are korean, i'd stick with that menu. the sushi is decent, but again... nothing is really that good, although it is on the cheap side."
pos,"YELP REVIEWS IN CANADA, EH?

CN Tower rocks
Its high and provides great views
Gary Carter yeah!"
neu,"To put it simply it is what it is.  If you want the Belagio - go stay there.   There is a reason the hotel is so much cheaper than many of the top vegas hotels.   Personally, when in Vegas, I spend very little time in my room so I would spend my money elsewhere.

Location - The hotel is next to the Tropicana and across the street from the MGM Grand- it is more or less on the strip.

Room - As stated its cheap beach motif.  Lots of light colored wood.   The only real problem I had was that the elevator was pretty dam slow.

My only advice is to NOT stay in the ""Bungalos"" out by the pool.. We started there - but managed to move into the main hotel.

Look if you want a cheap room around th strip this place is a good value."
neg,"J. Alexander's is not normally a place I would frequent, but we had a couple of birthdays to celebrate at work and it is right across the street. So a group of about 10 of us went.
I ordered the steak and fries, the steak rare, and clam chowder. The clam chowder was awesome. My steak came and it was  well done. So, with these prices, I figured I should get what I asked for, so I sent it back. It came back rare alright. The first few bites were cold in the center and then it got to barely warm. Not impressive at all. And honestly, I can cook a better steak than that.
Everyone else loved their meal, though.
The service their is over the top, more than a bit too much. There are people constantly walking by, even standing and staring at your table at some point. Hang on to your plate, because the moment you pause from your meal, someone is there to snatch it. I think maybe they have cameras over the tables and an observation room, ""Iced tea refill, table twelve, repeat, iced tea refill table twelve, over!"" Though the wait staff did not appear to have ear-pieces, you still get the impression these are secret service wanna-be's, ready to dive to save your dropped spoon from hitting the floor.
The menu had a lot of good, but traditional, items on it, steak, salads, burgers, sandwiches, all high-end, fresh, homemade, etc.
Maybe if I had ordered something else my experience might have been totally different. But, even with work picking up the tab, I managed to have a bad free meal."
pos,I love Crate and Barrel.  It's a great place to go to celebrate Spring!.  They have a lot of great outdoor furniture and accessories to get you in the mood for Summer.  I picked up some very nice glassware and some beautiful silver serving plates.  I also fell in love with a couple magnolia branches and a huge pale blue glass vase.  It's nice to breathe a little Spring into my pad!
neu,"I had high hopes for this restaurant.  It was a 30 minute drive from Laveen, as all are the Thai places in the area.  I ordered two of my staples (Tom ka Gai soup and Green Curry) and tried a new dish (for me), Holy Basil.  I got everything takeout.

I'll start with the Holy Basil.  It was very good.  A nice balance of Thai flavors, and I thought it was quite similar to an Ayam Basil dish I used to get at a Malaysian place in Mt. View, CA.  My only complaint was that the chicken was big, thick chunks, like a fajita-style.  I expect delicate, tender meats at a high end Thai place.

I opened my green curry and said: ""WHERE'S THE SAUCE""?  I am VERY upset at the lack of sauce.  There was so little I can't comment on the flavor of the curry.  And, they had 2 different types of green beans in there:  chinese long beans, and American green beans.  The larger Amercian green beans weren't cooked.  That sucked.  The beef was tender enough but the peices were too big.  The one redeeming part of this dish was the fact that they had eggplant in it.  There is something about eggplant in green curry....

The Tom Ka Gai soup was  fantastic.  My only complaint would be the chicken, which again, was large fajita-style slices.   Doesn't make sense to me.

While I was waiting at the bar for my order, I remember looking into the kitchen and wondering how they could possibly prepare everything on the menu in that tiny space.  Now, I think I know:  I suspect they prep all of their meats ahead of time and use the same size/shape/cuts for each dish to save time.  This results in a fajita-style cut of chicken that leaves me less than thrilled.

Overall, the menu is brief and the food is good, but I don't think it's worth a long drive.  I don't expect to return when I could make the same drive to get to Swadee, which was just fabulous.  I gave this place a 3/5 because the Tom Ka Gai soup and Holy Basil were VERY good.  I am however disappointed in the green curry, the  cuts of meat, and by the way they completely ignored my request for Thai spicy; everything was rather mild in my opinion."
neu,"C Moore's is a nice place.  The only ""neighborhood"" bar I know of in Tempe.  Good beer selection and some decent eats.  I'd visit it again."
neu,"I'd never been to Tommy's Burgers when I lived in So. Cal, so my trip there on New Year's Eve was my first experience.

A limited menu, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  Basically it's a question of just how big you want your chili cheeseburger, because let's face it: you don't go to Tommy's for anything else.

My double cheeseburger combo was around $7.00 - with a large drink!  (Oh, big bonus here - they actually brew real iced tea, none of that syrupy crap.)

My take-away order was ready before I was done fixing my iced tea - everything nicely wrapped up in yellow paper.  Nothing sloppy or greasy about these chili cheeseburgers.

When I got home, I was impressed.  The fries were tasty, and meaty: no skinny, crunchy fries here.  Golden and crisp on the outside, fluffy and light on the inside.

The burger was really tasty too.  The chili is a very thick, meaty concoction with lots of chili flavor, but hardly any spice.  The burgers are served with tomato, onion, pickle and mustard in addition to the chili.  I know it sounds weird, but it works.

The location is a bit hard to get into, but I imagine they'll do a good business from the hospital and nearby offices.

All in all, not the best burger I've ever had, but definately different from anything else here in Vegas, which makes it a welcome addition to the drive-thru listings."
pos,"3 1/2 Stars.

Girl's choice last night.... and we (my sister, my niece Carol, and myself) ended up at the Famous Dave's in Chandler. These Famous Dave's look like every other one... typically bright Orange and Yellow! At night, you must have deficient eyesight if you can't find a Famous Dave's! In the evening, Famous Dave's is just a lighthouse beacon in the middle of a drab mall!

On the menu...

Blue Margarita (** 1/2) made with Blue Curacao - It's disconcerting when the last time you saw your niece she was just drinking Cokes... now it's Blue Margaritas. Must be getting old. In summary... not very toxic. Could have drank this in one gulp and wouldn't have had an effect! Machine mixed and made. Looked cool, though, with an Aquamarine Blue color.

All American BBQ Feast (****) Gimmick is that all this stuff ( Full Slab of St Louis style SpareRibs (*****), Whole BBQ Chicken (*** 1/2), 1/2 lb of Texas Beef Brisket (*****), Famous Fries (*****), 2 Baked Potatoes with all the Fixin's (*****) replaced the Coleslaw and Wilbur Beans, 4 Corn on the Cob (***), 4 Muffin Style Corn Bread (****) ) is served on a bright, shiny, galvanized Garbage Can lid. Some of the items definitely lacking in BBQ flavor.

Hot Fudge Kahlua Brownie (**) Warm, Walnut covered Chocolate Brownie, soaked with Kahlua Liquer and topped with Vanilla Bean Ice Cream, Hot Fudge, and (loads and loads of) Whipped Cream. Ice Cream and Kahlua was no-where to be found!

Total tab: $82.08. Not bad for the amount of food.

Service (****) This is a total generalization... but what the heck! The wait-staff at Famous Dave's is totally opposite from the previous evening's robotic lifeless performance from the wait-staff at Olive Garden ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/olive-garden-italian-restaurant-chandler#hrid:l6HajH2UNtb1EZMTj19Ccg  ). I really don't give a darn if it's just a performance... the attitude that the wait-staff presents will be passed onto the customers... whether bad or good.

Typical of all Famous Dave's you sit at a booth or table covered with Red and White checkered table-cloths. At the front entrance is a display of all the BBQ awards that Famous Dave's BBQ items have won.... mostly in the MidWest. Check out the lead-pipe utilitarian interior design... Cool!

Very colorful and festive atmosphere! Kids or adults with a kid's attitude will love Famous Dave's."

neu,"OK this is tough... I love martinis.. I love happy hours... but I do hate places that are a ""scene"". My friend, fiance and I ordered 3 martinis. My friend's martini tasted ok, but the waitress sniffed it and said ""hmm that smells funky I don't think that's the pear martini""... it tasted good to us (however, agreed, it didnt' taste like a pear). She returned with a martini that tasted like lemon clorox (how I would imagine it would taste!)... ewww.. nothing like pears... 

Anyways, needless to say at a packed place the service can suffer... and the quality of product... I much prefer the 1/2 price martinis at Hanks !!!"
neg,"Pathetic is one word to describe this hotel. 

The rooms are dingy. 

The elevators are super slow. 

Most of the lights in your room will not work. 

They don't even have Showtime or HBO on your room TV. 

And the entire hotel smells like stale smoke. 

What else should I of expected from a hotel that prides itself on the number of beer pong tables it has? 

And don't get me started about Saturday night at the casino. 

The hotel basically turns into a whos whos of wanna be Las Vegas gangsters. I will give Las Vegas wanna Be's some credit. 

At least they keep their pants up above their ass unlike their California compatriots. 

Yuck!"

pos,"So there I was, at 11 am on a Sunday morning, standing adjacent to the bathroom in a narrow hallway, behind a long line of other prospective patrons...

A long line means either the restaurant is poor at seating, serving and turning over or the food is just that good.  Happily for creme de la creme, it is the latter.  (A small caveat here - I have a soft spot for family owned restaurants).

Orange juice, tea, medium poached eggs and toast with melty butter & jam is my idea of a good breakfast...add in the hash browns and tomatoes and you've got a fan!  My friend had a bespoke omlette that looks huge, but delicious!

The hustle and bustle, the good-humoured family atmosphere and being served by people who love what they do all added to the ambience...I'd go back for sure...I'll try the eggs benny with salmon next!"

4. i ordered a burger. this burger was great! exactly like i ordered it which seems to be a rare thing here in AZ. people are always cooking burgers to the wrong specs..but this place...well...this place did it right! thank you! 
5. my lady ordered the philly steak sandwich. she seemed to enjoy it. i took a bite as well. it was ok i guess. could use a little more flavor but besides that...it wasn't that bad.

Now that is saying a lot because I love the hummus at Pita Jungle and I never thought I would ever dethrone their dish, but alas I have. Be forewarned it is very garlicky!( Probably why I love it so much!)  I had the shrimp dumplings and shaved turkey sandwich with Sweet Potato Hash( bland) . It was good but nothing to write home about. They have funny non alcoholic drinks with cute names that my friends say are great though I did not have one.( NOjito for no alcohol Mojito-funny!) I would say check it out but be forewarned it is a bit BILTMORE STUFFY for an average Joe or Josephine and it is very expensive. The service was outstanding. At one point I had 5 servers waiting on me at once. Some people do not like that, but I sure do!!"
neu,"SRCC is your parents resort...Solid, but dated.  Touts its AAA 4-Star rating, but you'll be thinking, 'eh, just barely.'

Take my guest room, please (parents generation joke): 
-TWO desks (I have never seen that before).  But how about a couch in place of one???   
-'flo-through' closet (doors at either end).  But, its too cramp to step into.  
-Two bathroom sinks and vanities.  But at the very low height.  One has a stool that is but 2' feet tall--I guess for the lady to sit and apply gobs of make-up.   
-Very few ice machines can require a 5-minute trek

4-Star, but:
-Most interior common areas are intimate.  Not high, cathedral ceilings common in more modern resorts.  The front desk is down right quaint. 
-Room service quits at 11PM.
-On Friday night, SRCC's sole lounge closed around midnght and doesn't open again til 4PM.
-Main pool is simple and square.  Absolutely no vibe. With lounge chairs perfectly aligned in military rows, like troops.  Music?  You don't need no stinking music.  
-Want to order food and drink lounging at the newer, round, Casita Pool?  it takes a phone call and you'll pay room service delivery charges.,,ouch
-Decent health club, but a single TV in its large room and no earplug audio outlets.  And no cleaners to wipe-down equipment!
-A lot of wear-and-tear throughout.  I know the economy is bad and hotels everywhere have cut back.  But, SRCC looks like its delayed maintenance goes back to before this recession hit.

If SRCC didn't make its 4-Star ubiquitous or simply dropped to 3-stars, the shortcomings I cite, wouldn't be really noteworthy.  But, if you want to claim ""a high level of service...and facilities"" you've got to delivery."
pos,"After reading all these great reviews, I decided to take my newly acquired beater car (only need it for a year - fingers crossed that it makes it!) to be inspected. Christina helped me setting up an appointment on the phone and she was super nice! After that, Bogi was my main contact and she was so helpful and informative!! She went over everything that was wrong with the car and then pointed out the most critical things that needed to be fixed right away. I could definitely tell that she understood my situation with not wanting to put a ton of money into an older car, and I know that most other auto repair shops wouldn't have cared about that at all. Bogi takes a very personal approach and that is why she has such great reviews from her customers. I will definitely be taking my hunk of junk back to 180!!!"
neu,"4 Americans on a business trip for the week, we wanted to grab some sushi one night in Toronto and a friend had ordered delivery from here before and was pleased. We went in for dinner and ordered several different sushi rolls and a couple of appetizers. One of the appetizers was rolled up beef and cilantro which was fantastic. Another app was not memorable. I had a miso soup that was decent. Can't remember all the sushi rolls we got exactly but I remember there was a shrimp tempura one, a spicy tuna which was great, a salmon roll and some others. 

The servers working there that evening were all very attractive Japanese women and were quick to refill our drinks and bring us anything we asked for. The restaurant is small, but it was almost full and our food came out fairly quickly. Prices were reasonable. Nothing we had blew me away, but everything we had was good. I'm sure it's not the best place for sushi in Toronto but it was above average and overall a good spot."
neu,"If I have forgotten my lunch (or been too lazy to make one) and need to quickly jump out and get something - I go here.

Prices are cheap and the jerk pork is great.  That could really be their slogan.

This place is always busy and the parking lot can be a bit of a dodge game, but it is worth it.  I recommend the patties, jerk pork and rice and peas. They have burgers, etc on the menu, but I haven't tried those (yet).

Avoid the gravy - it is a bit too salty.  If you want some sauce on your rice (hello - who doesn't?!) ask for the curry sauce.

They also have a little grocery store and in house bakery (haven't tried those yet either)."
neg,"If your looking for great magic/illlusion or if you looking for good cirque, you'll be disappointed.  The illusions were amateuristic and the writing was bad - maybe Criss shouldn't be writing his own  scripts focus on illusions instead.  I would have felt better losing my $150 in th slots than seated in the audience waiting for the show to improve."
neg,"This restaurant goes on my list of top ten worst dining experiences ever.  While, admittedly, we went on a night when they were short-staffed because of several staff emergencies, most of our problems with the place would have occurred even if they had more staff.  

On the positive side, the restaurant is really beautiful inside - very elegant and stylishly decorated.  Charlotte really needs more restaurants like Kalu (at least in strategy).  However, our overall experience was so poor that we would absolutely never return.

Here were some of the reasons why:
1) Kalu is kind of off-the-beaten-path, and not in a good way.  There is no private lot with free parking, but at least they now have valet parking (which I will only use if I have to).  If you prefer to park in a garage near EpiCentre, you will walk a couple of blocks to get there in a not-so-nice area.
2) At Kalu, they bring food out at random.  There's no trying to coordinate items at your table so all parties are at least eating something at the same time.  My husband got his appetizer and two entrees before the other two of us got anything.  That's ridiculous.
3) Food is brought by all of the waiters, but you can forget asking them for anything.  We asked one waiter for some water, and he said we would have to ask our server for that.  What?!
4) Portions are small.  The Pork Shiu Mai was served as three dumplings.  The Ishiyaki Steak was served as two tiny skewers.  The Unagi Sansho (eel sushi) was also a small portion (four pieces, I think).  The Shoyu Truffle Butter rice pot could be shared if you got other items to fill you up.  You really need to order more than you normally do to feel full.  
5) There was nothing spectacular about the food.  I know that Kalu made Esquire's recent top 20 list of US restaurants, but maybe the reviewer ordered the more costly things that we did not.   The only dish we really liked was the truffle butter rice pot, and it was not good enough for us to want to return.  
6) The prices are high for the portion sizes.  Yes, I know, we Americans expect big portions, but I'd at least like to feel full after eating an appetizer and an entree. I did not.  Our friend was not so lucky.  He NEVER GOT his main entree, so he just told the waitress to forget it so we could leave.  

I know the staff were frazzled because our waitress kept apologizing, but she never really checked to see how we were doing.  It literally took 20 minutes from placing our drink order to actually get our drinks.  (The food started arriving before we got our drinks.)  The executive chef brought out one of our items and our friend kindly asked if they were having a bad day.  He mentioned the emergencies bit, but he failed to apologize for the experience. That would have gone a long way in our book.  Overall, the staff (including the executive chef) need a refresher course in providing good service if they want any customers to return.  And the menu, well, just go there expecting to pay a bundle and make sure you order enough to at least go home full."
neu,"I really wanted to see what the hype was all about with Pink's Hot Dogs.  I have to say it can be good depending on what you order.  

The Planet Hollywood Dog really blew me away.  It was just loaded with bacon, cheese, mushrooms, and onions.  It was a complete task just trying to keep it together while eating it.  And somewhere under all that mess was a Polish Dog.  It was really good!  Worth the $8.50?  Well, it's on the Strip so I'm not going to knock it on price.

I also ordered the Pastrami Reuben Dog.  This one didn't really blow me away, but it was also a task to keep this one together. Still good though, but it tasted like something I could've had at Nathan's.   Price was a little cheaper though at $7.50.

So yeah, I spent about $16 on two hot dogs.  Sounds crazy I know, but now at least have a taste of what Pink's has to offer.  Maybe next time I'll give their Pastrami Burrito Dog a shot.  Looks really heavy! 

It was A-Ok!"
pos,"Good ambiance.... my friend said he first started coming here in 2004, when they were just starting out and before the owner bought out the sushi place next door.  He said it's come a long way since then. This place has a great, relaxed atmosphere... there are karaoke rooms for fobby gatherings.  I would come here again if given the chance.  The peach soju = :)"
neu,"I went today for lunch, disappointed.  I got the lonely bird again, it wasn't as good as the first time.  They lack consistency.  My friend got the miso burgo and really liked it.  The apple lychee soda, I'm not really a fan, it was kinda off, like not that refreshing or needed more carbonation.  The service today was horrible.  From the time we walked in to the time we got our food was over 40 mins, we didn't even have to wait for a table.  I'd go back, maybe for a different burger.  I would avoid lunch time, either go before or after the rush.  The service was that slow..."
neu,"The drive from my apartment to this restaurant along Southern Avenue is an interesting 5 mile stretch.  We start near a retirement community, replete with 70-80 year olds who have absolutely no shame in flaunting themselves in speedos on a hot summer day on thereafter desecrated sidewalks.  Continuing on, a veritable gauntlet of strip malls appear offering all types of wares, services, in a strictly lower middle income suburbia.  The next area is a heavily hispanic area with nary an English sign in sight, besides Massage brazenly displayed along shaded glass storefronts.  Finally, our destination appears, and it is truly in an imposing corner, flanked by a Big Lots, great america, and a pawn shop, complete with a watchful security guard along the storefront.  In this truly welcoming environment, we damn near sprinted from the Red Dragon ( also known as my car ) into Salvadoreno.

And this is where the magic begins.

The legend of pupusa has been ringing in my soul for nearly an hour, and I was not about to leave without satisfying that call.  Never having had it before didn't prevent me from ordering 3 varieties, with the steak being my girlfriend's favorite, mine being the pork and beans, and the simple cheese coming in at a comfortable third.  Pressed pockets of incredible goodness inside a expertly pressed tortilla, was served with a mild salsa and curtido- spicy, peppery pickled vegetables.  Combining all of these components, I have abandoned my long-standing vow to hate all those who use bumper stickers and have been inspired to promote the cause, I love (heart symbol) pupusas.  

As this was my first foray into Salvadorian food, I also ordered Lengua Guisada, which came as 3 slabs of stewed beef tongue, covered in a slightly sour tomato based sauce.  The sourness combined with the beef tongue's gamey texture I found very pleasing, but this was slightly below room temperature, and definitely marred my enjoyment of this dish.

Both of our entrees also came with pedestrian rice and watery black beans, with the latter being flavorful but far too liquidy.  I also had a cup of Sopa de Res con Chipilin with my entree, which tasted like countless other Sopa de Res elsewhere.  

Pupusas were absolutely wonderful, but the full experience was marred by my weaker entree and the side dishes.  With that said, I will gladly challenge the land of hispanic / lower income / scary gun-wielding-guard-outside-a-pawn-shop again if only I can have once again the sublime experience of pupusa once more."
neu,"I've been here a couple of times but only because of proximity. This place is always packed but think its more due to the fact that there really isn't any competition in the area.  It's related to the Zipps chain so the menu is similar.  Wings and burgers are decent but the prices are a little high for a sports bar.

Don't really like the setup or the screens as watching a game is a little awkward and can leave you with a neck sprain.  Despite a number of different screens the quality of the screens are surprisingly bad.  They need to send someone up on the roof to adjust the antenna or update the technology.

This place always gets high marks from the local paper but I just don't see it."
neu,"Was very excited to try this place because of all the reviews, but turned out to be disappointing. We should have known from the ten minute wait compared to the 2-4 hour wait at M Buffet. lol.
They did have a good variety of different kinds of foods. I liked the tapas style so that you could easily try a bit of everything. The bone marrow and watermelon gazpacho was interesting to try. Downsides: crab was overly dry, the tuna roll only had a hint of tuna, salads were not very fresh, no alcohol included with meal (compared to M).
Good experience, but would not go again."
neu,"So I finally made it to Volos after hearing so many great things about it (mostly from the Yelp Charity Week in September with one of the events being held here). Moreover, I have just come back from a very special place in Greece (any one heard of Mount Athos were no women are allowed...not even female animals?) and I knew I had to find a place that captured that essence of fresh and warm Greek food.

Intro. Reservations were for 7:30pm and I was originally brought to a table of people that were clearly not my friends. Apologetic faces were aplenty and the manager even came to help straighten things out. I was told that the table was not yet ready and was invited to have a seat by the bar and to enjoy some drinks. I had a glass of the Cuvee Prestige (white) $12/glass and it was recommended by the hostess as a very popular glass with citrus notes. I really enjoyed it. FYI. The hostess also mentioned that I could taste sampler's of different wines before committing which I thought was excellent.
 
Our table was ready and was originally for four, but we actually had 5 guests. I have to say that the restaurant was very accommodating and gave us a round table for 5 which the waitress had originally said was one of the most popular and booked tables/place. Very gracious.

Food. To my utter disappointment, the Mousaka was all sold out. That only attested to the popularity of the dish and I vowed I would return to have it. My second choice was the Cornish Hen which surprisingly was very tender and juicy. It came with a side of mashed potatoes and in no time, I had devoured the whole hen. I am not usually a white meat gal, but even that was so delish. For appetizers, I had the Dolmades (4 pieces) and it came with the most heavenly yoghurt sauce (Taziki) ever: thick, tasty, and cold as Greek Yoghurt should be. 

Other dishes worth mentioning are the Exohico (lamb in Phyllo Pastry) which both my friends raved and ate in a flash and Saganaki as an app (the signature flamed cheese). For dessert, my boyfriend and I shared the very typical dessert Baklava which will satisfy any sweet tooth.

Service. Gracious. And very accommodating. Everyone was so nice and nothing was ever a problem. The owner of the restaurant (I believe Andreas) who looks like a real-life version of Fairy Godmother's son Prince Charming from Shrek...but minus the gold-Pantene-Pro-V-commericial-hairtoss-in-slow-mo-locks periodically would check up on our table. At the end of the evening, he asked how we heard of the restaurant and was very obliging in listing out all the events that could take place in Volos. 

Our waitress handled our request for 5 individual bills with no smirk, eye-roll or sigh so don't be afraid to ask. At the end, she even told our table that she had to do 16 individual bills for a party beside us so clearly not an issue.

Conclusion. I think this restaurant is an absolute gem: food, service, and ambiance (earthy, rustic tones). There is absolutely no pretentious-ness here which makes the shining star, Greek Food, come out."
neu,"I would just like to point out that there are two different China Star restaurants on Murray Ave.  The one across from the Giant Eagle is the good one.  They just opened a few month ago.  This is their second restaurant, so you know they're pretty good.  Their first restaurant's on McKnight Road in McIntyre Square.  I recommend reading a few of the review for their other restaurant if you want get an idea of what they're about. 

The good China Star serves authentic Sichuan style Chinese food.  You can tell they're authentic and good cause when you walk in, many of their customers are Chinese.  For those of you who like the general tso's and lo meins, not to worry cause they have all the ""fake"" Chinese food too.  Some of my favorites are their tan tan noodles, scallion pancake, shrimp in chili sauce, double cooked pork, garlic egg plant and they have hot pot!  So, if you don't know which China Star to go to, pick this one.  It's just a few minutes away and the food is much MUCH better.  I would give this restaurant a 4.5 out of 5 stars just because the serves could have been better (not to say it was bad).

I've actually tried the other China Star too.  No authentic food there, but their ""fake"" Chinese food wasn't bad...it wasn't very good either.  It's kind of funny but I think the non-authentic Chinese food from the other China Star is better.  In short, if I feel like some good old general tso's, I'd rather go somewhere else.  I would give this restaurant a 2 out of 5 stars because the food is edible but nothing special at all."
pos,"Midwood smokehouse is a welcomed new addition to the neighborhood.  They have awesome beer specials every day during the week that go great with whatever 'cue you order.  I had the Texas style brisket yesterday and it was to die for.  No knife necessary, most tender brisket I've ever eaten at a barbecue joint.  The bacon wrapped jalepenos are delicious.  The first time I had them they were very spicy ad second time not as much. (I preferred the spicier version).  Smoked vegetable special was divine--portabellas, squash, onion, and more cooked in their custom made smoker to perfection.  The smoke flavor brought out the meatiness in the fresh veggies without overwhelming them.  Will definitely be visiting Midwood Smokehouse regularly.  Brisket is a must."
neu,"Look, you do not come to Zipps to fine dine. The food is average, but is great when you just want some nachos or wings. This place is for happy hour & for watching sports if you care about sports. The patio is nice too, but I avoid it since people smoke out there. blech

There's always has been room for anywhere from 5-15 of us to get a table. They are great about letting you pull tables together too. Some places are so rude about that.  It's never cramped & the place is clean. There's usually a cool mix of people in & no douchey attitude. 

I must recommend a Zipparita if you've never tried one. I don't usually do a frozen margarita, but I make an exception for this one. Let's just say they put a limit on how many you can buy for a reason.

They do lose a star for not having Tito's vodka. Seriously Zipps, please fix that issue right away. 

I am in here at least once every couple of weeks. If you see me, come say hi & buy me a Zipparita...and nachos and wings. Ok kidding, you only have to buy me a Zipparita. :)"

Joey noticed that I had nowhere to go, so he drove me to a nearby shopping plaza so I could hang out for a few hours, and then picked me up when my car was ready. Totally impressed, and highly recommended. What a great deal."
neu,"I don't know what OHSO is trying to be. The spiffy name and sleek exterior make you think you are in for an inventive, trendy experience. The interior, though, is a little modern, a touch industrial, with a heavy dose of down-home Midwest, sort of ""modern barn"" as my SO eloquently deemed it. There is a good beer list, but it's not insane. The menu is pretty standard, but the inclusion of a children's menu threw me for a bit of a loop, especially since the median age of the patrons there appeared around 50. 

The place was moderately busy, but service was sort of spotty. I tried a couple of their specialty cocktails: good but not great. We started with the green chile dip, which ended up being what seemed eerily similar to spicy hummus, just served hot. The ""flatbread"" on the side (essentially pita) was accompanied by potato chips. Just.... odd. Not bad, just odd. The grilled cheese was good and the ingredients fresh, but nothing to write home about. The fries were tasty, probably because they reminded us both of McDonald's. The small side of bread and butter pickles was amazing - the best part. We ordered the apple pie a la mode, with cinnamon ice cream. The dessert was amazing, really, although there was a heavy dose of peanut butter which really threw us off. Turns out they were out of cinnamon ice cream, and subbed in the PB version on the fly. Probably would have been nice to know on the front end....

Overall, a solid ""meh"". I love seeing unique places like this pop up in the neighborhood, but I don't know that OHSO has enough panache to survive..."
neg,"Well if you like cookie cutter food this is the place for you!! There is definitely a science into putting out mediocre food that ""everyone"" likes. If you like Kraft dinner and zoodles type of food this is the place for you! This place appeals to the masses. As a real ""foodie"" i really expect more out of my restaurants food. I am looking for more than big screens and hot waitresses. Which there were plenty of. But for now I am rating the FOOD. I ordered the Fries (McDonald's style) blah.. Onion rings... Blah frozen style and the breaded pickles. They were good but still not freshly made. Onto the wings.... Hey wings are wings right... but it's the bottle sauce you can buy at the super market that separates them!! Oh wait did I say that out loud? Ya cookie cutter conglomerate is the key phrase of the day here. Besides paying a dollar each wing for something you could thaw out and reheat yourself hey not a bad deal. Do you detect the sarcasm? Hope those big screens keep you warm and fuzzy as this place drains your wallet. I personally like value added to my food equation. Which I truly believe for what you're paying for you should just be at Hooters and at least you could have some T/A in your face."
neu,"This was my first time stay at the Rio, so here's the breakdown. 

Staff: 5/5
Friendly & polite.

Room: 3.5/5
It was a conjoined room (suite), and I had the room with the king-sized bed all to myself. The room includes a sectional sofa, tube t.v., a Jack & Jill sink, & a typical shower/bathroom. The reason why I gave it a 3.5, is because the pictures from the t.v. fluctuated between black and white, and then to color.  And the floors needed to be vacuumed, or at least underneath the bed.

Bed: 5/5
So COMFORTABLE.  Not too stiff or too soft, just the right amount of firmness to give you support, yet cradles the body.

Extras: 5/5
I love that they give you a mini fridge, that kept my water and left-overs nicely chilled.  There's also an ironing board and iron; good for last minute presses.  Hairdrier (standard), and a single cup coffee maker (coffee is, of course comes with a fee).

Noise level: 4/5
Walls are pretty insulated, however, loud conversations can be heard, though. But overall, outside noise was kept close to none."

pos,"If you're looking for true *gaming enthusiasts*, this is the store to go. It's a retail store, a repair store, and fount of information regarding gaming in general, and with a wide variety of used and classic games, to boot.

The closest store to this feel in Toronto is VideoGamesPlus(VGP). VGP is more retail focused, with a proper online website, but the Gamerama folk strike me far more as gaming enthusiasts first and foremost.

If you want a local retail experience where you can support local Toronto businesses (and not franchises), VGP and gamerama are the places to go. If you want to buy from a group of people who live, breathe, and truly *understand* the world of gaming, and can provide unique insight and advice? Gamerama is it.

You want top notch retail ""service""? go upstairs to EBGames, where they'll ring you through quickly, but treat you like a number, have no interest in dissuading you from an unwise buy, etc.

To me, the choice is clear. Thanks, Gamerama!"

neu,"I liked my breakfast and so did my partner but I do find the ""help yourself to lemonaide or ice tea or water"" a bit misleading.  I saw the sign that it was 2.75, but I dont think a lot of people do so they end up paying for drinks they think are free.  I had an egg white omelette with mushrooms, mozzarella and marinara sauce.  The home fries were good and the biscuit was tasty( although small).  My partner had the classic american breakfast and it was advertised as 2 eggs, but seemed like a lot more.  We ordered a muffin that was tasty but once again I had an issue.  The menu said 2.50, but we were charged 2.95.  The mistake was fixed once I pointed it out, but how often has that happened?"

I have seen a fair amount of magic shows on the strip, and there wasn't anything revolutionary about Copperfield. I guess if you want to see one show on the strip with a huge budget and a name, go for this, but I think that Penn and Teller are a lot better and a lot funnier. Also, the Copperfield tickets are outrageously priced, even at the half price booths that line the strip. If you're up for this, be prepared."

The owner/chef has worked at fabulous restaruants here in the valley.  I think part of the staff needs to be trained a little more.  But I have had servers there that were also amazing and very professional.  They have a cute little fire place you can sit near and is great when the weather is cold. I can't wait until they open up for brunch. BRAVO Mr. Rusconi.

Had the grilled octopus as an appetizer, cooked very well, not over cooked and te sauce was good. Only one issue, forgot to season the octopus. No salt, no pepper on the octopus.

Would eat here here again for sure."

This package required signature confirmation so I got a delivery attempt notice at my door.  A couple of days later when I went to claim my package- they couldn't find it!  Sadly this is not the first time.   I have dropped packages (with tracking) off- only for them to never leave the post office and mysteriously disappear.  Unfortunately, this is also that post office that delivers to my house.  Two Amazon packages tracked as delivered to my house were never received.

neu,"Man, did I want to love this place. It has a cool atmosphere, friendly service, good beer selection, and a menu that had me wanting way more than I could eat. This is just a fun place to be.

As an appetizer, we had Jalapinkies, which were quite delicious and imaginative. Jalapeños stuffed with pimento cheese, dipped in corn dog batter and fried. They were huge, but I managed to eat more than one because they good. The crab hush puppies and fried pickles we ordered were popular too.

So this seems like a fairly glowing review so far, why did I only give it 3 stars? The burger. I'm a burger fanatic and I'm always looking for new and fun burger flavors. I'm not picky, I'm not a snob, but I do have some standards.

I ordered a Triple G burger Ding Dong style. That's a 3 patty burger with crunchy peanut butter, honey-cilantro slaw and hot sriracha sauce. It sounded amazing, but there's a snag, they only cook the burger patties to a particular doneness. OVERdone. 

The dry burger patties overpowered the toppings on the burger that originally made it sound so appealing in the first place. I decided to remove a patty to see if I had less meat, would the other flavors come thru? Nope. Maybe one patty. Not much better.

I did have a bite of the bun and found the combination of runchy peanut butter, honey-cilantro slaw and hot sriracha sauce to be a great idea. It's too bad the overcooked meat was the most dominant flavor. I was disappointed.

If this place fixes how it cooks it's burgers, it would definitely be a must stop whenever I'm in Charlotte."

It's like someone took the themes from ""A Clockwork Orange"" and ""The Warriors"" and threw them in the J. Paul Getty Museum..haha 

This gym does offer top of the line fitness equipment, lots of amenities and a host of classes such as yoga, spin, Pilates...etc. I can naturally see why DBG would attract a lot of attention and appeal to the public.  Being an athlete myself, I personally would never train at a gym like this.  The last thing I have on my mind when I enter a gym is being comfortable. My mind is far from being able to kick back on plush purple couches and sip on a caramel macchiato....lol 

Now, I'm not saying you can't get a effective workout at this facility. I'm only stating this gym doesn't fit my training style.  If you are into Crossfit, MMA or Olympic lifting, this most certainly isn't the place for you. If you are not a fan of contracts or on a budget, again this isn't the place for you. The biggest deterrent for me was the price. When you join a fancy gym... ""fancy"" being the key word, its not going to be cheap by any means. There is absolutely no reason to pay $150 per month for a gym membership. I'm sorry, but...that's f**king ridiculous!!!!  

Bottom line there is a big difference in the words ""training"" and ""workout"". DBG is for a place for hipster youth to hang out and occasionally lift a weight or two in order for them to feel they are getting fit, a place to ""WORKOUT"".  Myself, when I hit the gym, I'm there to push my mind and body to the limit, making sure I can never say, ""Damn, I should have pushed myself harder"".  In short, I don't ""workout"", I TRAIN!!!"
pos,"I have been going to Rage for some time now and feel like it's about time I give a review.  The staff has always been friendly and willing to go out of their way to help me.  It's refreshing to see a shop that carries such a large number of mountain bike brands rather than the typical one or two big names.  Also one of the few (the only??) shops in the valley that carries a decent selection of DH gear.  One more thing, they actually have a pump track behind the shop that looks pretty killer, I hope to get over there when I have some time to actually ride.  Anyway, I highly recommend this shop!"
neg,"Meh sums it up. There are better middle eastern places out there, but if you're in the neighborhood, this will do. It's decent, just not much to write home about."
neg,"Not sure why people are so excited about this place. I think it is totally overrated. Today food was mediocre, service too and  price too high for what we got. We also had to switch tables because we had the AC blowing at our feet. The view is really nice but there are other places in Madison which have better food, better service and similar or even cheaper prices."
neu,"I don't see the big deal about this place, I really don't.

I frequently go to the Zx Gym multiple times a week, and every time I pass this restaurant the parking lot is crazy full. The last time we visited, it was extremely crowded, messy with peanuts everywhere, and the waitress was rude.

The food hasn't been disappointing though. I love their bread and butter."
neg,"I concur with Ross B.  I visited Yamato in it's last incarnation and was not pleased with the atmosphere, service or staff.  This evening my wife surprised me with a Groupon for the 'new and improved' Yamato.  Trust me it is neither!!  If I go to a Japanese steak house I expect someone of Japanese dissent to be somewhere on the premises.  The first visit, no Asians in sight.  This visit, the Sushi Chef was the only Asian there. The guys working 'the shows' at the Teppanyaki, not even close. The waitress was under age and couldn't serve us our wine or saki, minor delay. There was an issue with the taste of first wine poured.  Had to wait for the Sushi Chef (evidently also the head cashier) to finish dealing with another Groupon before he could pour the new glass; 7-10 minutes later (after most of the food was eaten) the 'chef' was gracious enough to pour the wine, but not bring it to the table, another delay to wait for the waitress to bring it.  Now I will say that the Wasabi dumplings were very tasty as was the Kobe Roll, but it did not make up for the short comings of the rest of our experience.  If I could, I'd give them ZERO stars as a rating.  STAY AWAY!  If they are truely owned by the local Kobe Steak House, save yourself the trip to Yamato and go to Kobe.  I've been there and have had a wonderful experience."
neg,"One employee ruined this place for me. He refused to mark my stained shirts, and of course they all came back still stained. He was then defensive and started arguing with ME... the paying customer! I would rather visit a friendly business where I get service with a smile, and not have to deal with arrogant, rude, argumentative, and lazy people!"
neu,"Okay, I realize that most people LOVE this place so my 3 stars is going to be frowned upon BUT I must admit that I'm not a huge pizza fan and the service was far from good.

We decided to try Grimaldi's late on a Saturday night.  The hostess was quick to seat us in a half empty restaurant.  Our waitress waited 8 minutes before stopping by our table.  She said she would be right back to take our drink order.  Approximately 10 minutes later she returned and said that she was so sorry and stated that they were so busy.  As I look around I notice that more then half the tables are empty and I see numerous waitresses.  Oh well, maybe she was new.  She brings our drinks by quite some time later and apologizes again.  I can't stand when people keep saying sorry with no meaning behind it!  If you're sorry, change what you are doing!!  Eventually we got some food!!

Pizza - you choose your toppings for every pizza which range from $2 a piece to $4 a piece.  You can easily make a $30 pizza.  It's thin crust and it was eh!

I ordered white Sangria which was different!  It kind of tasted like moscato and sprite with a slice of orange. 

The only pizza I really enjoyed was Pizza Fusion and they are gone! :'( I would try other pizza places before I came back here."
pos,"You know, Dr. Schanel is one of the nicest gentlemen I have met.  I'm diggin' his brown loafers, and his eye exam was fun.  And I told him that.  And he laughed at me and gave me the thumbs up.  

I've never in my life worn contacts.  I'm the kind of person who can't even put eye drops in my eyes without making it into a drama, so contacts??  Psshhhh... no way.  So for 4 years I avoided the thought, and for 4 years I was skippin' along with my cute lil purple eye glasses.  Until a while back when a co-worker of mine was punched in the face on a home visit and his eye glasses shattered and conveniently located shrapnel in his eye in a bloody mess.

Everyone on my team who wore (WORE being the key word here) glasses made eye exam appointments that day..  

So there's the background on how I ended up sitting in Dr. Schanel's office on my 10th failed attempt at getting these stupid contacts into my ever blinking eyes.  Dr. Schanel's wife runs the front of the store, and Dr. Schanel takes care of the back.  After a bit of encouragement and yet another failed attempt that left me sighing and feeling like a loser, Dr. Schanel sent in his wife, and she told me exactly how to keep my eye from blinking and get that damn contact in place.  And it worked!  I was so excited to tell Dr. Schanel!  He walked into the room and did a fist pump after seeing the huge grin on my face.  

And now I wear contacts to work everyday."
neg,"Ordered Kung pao chicken, potstickers, crab ragoons, chicken chow mein, salt and peppered shrimp. All the dishes lacked flavor. The last time I went the Kung pao was good but the Mongolian not So much. This Was the worst Chinese food I ever ordered. I have ordered there previously and it was decent that's why decided to order delivery. I will never order from there again.  So disappointed"
neu,".
Good place to ""Chil"" while waiting for my flight back down to the States. I'm used to having Margarita in a Chili's down in California, watching a ball game, talking Spanish to Spanish speakers, but this has got to be the first Margarita with Canadian Curling on the screen. Can you cross-check  with these brooms? I wonder.  The restaurant menu is fairly straight forward bar food, but good. Narrow aisle, just like aircrafts, so you will feel right at home. I'd come back."
pos,"AMAZING!!! This is a top notch destination attraction, just what Toronto needed. 
When you go, plan to spend lots of time there. We were there for almost 7 hours. Don't rush through as you will miss so much. We found that the longer you stay at each tank/display the more you saw. 
We went on Monday and it was not too busy which made it easier to stay for a long time but I understand that on the weekend there is a lineup to get in.
$30 at first seems expensive but once you have walked through the entire aquarium and taken part in all of the interactive activities the price seems very reasonable.  
The staff are all eager to help but need a bit more time to settle into their jobs to feel more comfortable as everyone seemed to be on edge.
The washrooms could have been a bit cleaner, there was water all over the counters and floors the couple of times I went, so more attendance there could have been beneficial.
We want to go back soon and maybe do the sleepover they offer to really enjoy the place when it is not crowded at all.
This is great fun for all ages and everyone should go."
pos,"The food is really good here, but kinda confusing on how to order.  There's really no order to the lines here, you kind of just get in a line and hopefully get what you want.  Other than that, I got the beef cheek, tongue, and carne asada.  Pretty good for a late night snack.  Best part of the experience is watching people coming from the club wasted trying to get their taco fix.  Recommend for a late night cheap eats on the strip."
neg,"Where do I start?? Ive been to several JCS's in the past but this one put such a bad taste in my mouth, I wont be visiting any of them, anytime soon.
First, I wanna say it wasnt busy for a Saturday night but by the way are waitress ""Britanny"" was acting, you would think a tourist bus just pulled up.
The 3 of us ordered cocktails and appetizers first, well the food came first, delivered by another person and cocktail arrived about 15 minutes after the appetizers.
We then ordered 3 entrees thru Britanny and 2 entrees got delivered, I asked the food carrier where's his entree and she looked very confused and said, let me go check. Fifteen minutes later his food arrived, needless to say we were all pretty mad by then. We also asked  for extra garlic bread, well that was silly, we were done with are entrees by the time it came. Through this whole ordeal we only saw Britanny 2 times, she gets a ""F"" in are book.
The manager heard are complaints and understood, discounted are bill and gave us a couple of appetizer coupons, not sure we will be going back."
neg,"Cabs in Phoenix are generally not the most reliable or easiest to get.  Going in you have to know to call well in advance to schedule a pickup if you want to get somewhere at a particular time.  Fine.  I went on their online booking site to request a cab several hours in advance to meet a friend.  The online booking process was easy and great.  I got an email right away confirming my booking with a link should I need to cancel and phone number if I need to call to check on my request.

Several hours later I call the number when the cab is 15 minutes late.  The operator was friendly and found my booking right away and was able to tell me instantly that no one was there because no cab had yet accepted my booking - also cabs today not going to the airport are running about 1 hour behind from the requested times.  I asked why no one called or emailed me (since the booking form asked for both) to let me know the cab was likely going to be an hour late if it came at all and apparently that isn't their policy.  Of course by this time when I tried calling other cab companies to get an ASAP pick up it was a 40 minute wait (since I didn't book in advance) and I missed my apt.  Thanks. . . ."
pos,"My husband and I recently purchased a new home and wanted to get the flooring done before we moved in.  Nulook was highly recommended.  The staff at Nulook was very tentative, and knowledgeable about flooring.  As a first time home buyer, I had a lot of questions, so it was so great to work with Apollo, who provided thorough and timely responses, especially with me being in a different state.
  
We chose engineered wood by Max Windsor in Coppermine for the downstairs and carpet upstairs.  They did an amazing job and completed the project within a week, which was perfectly on time before we moved in with all our furniture.  The new flooring adds a modern feel to our new home now.  We are constantly getting compliments about how amazing the floors are and would highly recommend Nulook to our friends and family.

Giving them a 5 start for the quality of work, friendly and honest staff, and on-time delivery!"
neg,Uhh don't stay here! Not an awful hotel but there are better options on the strip. The price was right and the room was decently clean. The staff has been friendly and responsive to any concerns but the location is not ideal. All the way at the end of the strip so getting anywhere takes forever! Check in was smooth and quick as well as getting our luggage up to the room. Our room was clean but the room temperature was uncomfortable. The air conditioner/heating unit was broken and our room was either freezing or a sauna...also the hotel reeks like marijuana 24/7. Our shower did not drain so showers had to be quick and you were stuck standing in your dirty shower water. The Wifi was also slow and cut out frequently. The room was very basic-no fridge or microwave. Overall the Luxor was okay but if it's not a holiday week there are definitely other comparably priced better hotels on the Strip!
neg,"The food is fine, if you actually get the order you've requested AND it's made to order the way you've requested. I've tried to do this twice and both times, my orders were not correct and the owner threw a fit about doing requests that they clearly say they are OK with honoring. The service is awful, the employees are so rude, and they don't give change. They just expect a tip on top of their delivery charge. I will never deal with them again. They clearly enjoy telling the customer they're wrong and don't care about customer service."
pos,"My friends and I had a great time here on a Friday night. The bartender was really attentive. I didn't notice any underage drinking (as other reviewers had) and the bartender carded everyone who approached the bar while I was there. 

We didn't have any food, but the drinks were fabulous. The mojito was the best I've ever had. And if you are looking for a great shot, ask for the Winter. 

I don't remember a DJ that night, but maybe he/she was on the pool side? 

The ambiance was really nice. Love the rooftop and the whole pool thing.

I would definitely return especially with a swimsuit to take advantage of the water."
pos,"When I first walked into Nordstrom Rack, I wasn't very impressed. However, after I spent more time going through the racks of clothes and shoes, my opinion changed. I ended up finding 2 great pairs of pants, some really cool shoes and boots, and a cute pair of earrings. The prices were good, and I was pleased overall. It is like shopping at Marshalls or TJ Maxx.. you just need to have enough time to sift through all the racks before you come across some really good finds!"
neg,"Mainstream/overrated. Waited 2 1/2 hours just to get into tiesto. . Go to the neighboring clubs forsure. If you are a women trying to wear heels, don't bother because you will take them off in desperation of pain waiting in line.Won't recommend this club If you are trying to party ASAP"
neu,"I was really excited to have a new seafood restaurant in Scottsdale but was very underwhelmed with the food at cuttlefish. I loved the atmosphere.. But every dish I ordered was just okay. We shafted with the king crab Bloody Mary cocktail.. Flavor was great but crab was fishy, we had oysters which were also a little fishy, tuna appetizer was tiny and over priced. Mussels were the only thing we got that was actually delicious. Lobster ravioli was good but not anything too special. I will try one more time as I always give places 2 chances because you never know if they are having an off night."
pos,"Got take out for lunch here today.  Had salmon pita with side Greek salad-a great, reasonably healthy and reasonably priced lunch.  Salad was solid with good feta cheese and dressing.  Most importantly for me, the salmon pita contained a generous amount of salmon-and for $6! The owners also gave me a small piece of baklava for free, which I appreciated and enjoyed.  Will come back here for lunch."
pos,"Real Greek food, lamb on a spit, HUGE portions, and a very comfy overall feel to this place.
Staff is friendly...I'd totally go back :-)"
neg,"Have been back a couple times since. The food is still good. The prices went up slightly. But overall the big change is in the service. 

No one expects a sushi place to have good service but to have service that ruins your dinner? That's unacceptable. We had 3 servers help us over the course of the night, one kept forgetting to bring the things we asked her for, such as water and napkins and soy sauce (seriously they forgot soy sauce at a sushi place?!) another was so rude I couldn't believe it. And then the third was yelled at by a family at another table for sneezing in their food and walking away, and then they sent her our way!!! No thanks I don't want your sneeze near me. 

After we paid and left we yelled back, ""thanks for being rude."" Now I really won't go back."
neg,"Presby had its annual free holiday lunch yesterday, and I partook.  I don't like to look a gift horse in the mouth, but it reminded me of why I refuse to spend money on the swill served here.  Trust me when I say that you don't need to have dietary restrictions to realize that the food served here is piss poor, even by cafeteria standards.

As I filed through the lunch line, I was asked if I'd like a stuffed pot-pie style chicken breast, and I assented.  Seeing ham with pineapple, I went to get a slice, but was told that I could only have one entree.  Um, okay, but perhaps I could have been asked if I wanted chicken, ham, or eggplant, instead of simply being asked if I wanted chicken.  Anyway, going down the line, I was offered white rice and cooked baby carrots, which I accepted.  The salads, which I encountered next, looked rather wilted, but I took one anyway, since I wanted some greens with my meal.  After that, I took a dinner roll and butter, dipped myself some eggnog, and took two pastries.

Doesn't free food always taste best, you ask?  Well, that adage certainly didn't apply here, since this food was no better than the usual offerings.  If I had to describe the taste in a word, ""bland"" would be the one that I choose.  Even so, I ate all of it except for the wilted salad, since it was, indeed, free.  The best part of the meal was the eggnog, which I'm sure was straight out of a jug, but was nevertheless more flavorful than even the pastries.

I appreciate Presby's effort to get into the holiday spirit--really, I do.  However, their execution needs work.  For example, not pre-dressing the salads would avoid the wilting problem--which, by the way, was present at last year's holiday meal as well.  While I'm tempted to give them two stars for effort, I'm going with my original assessment of one due to the their use of all styrofoam containers, which shows no concern for the environment.  Considered in conjunction with the lackluster lunch options at other nearby eateries, the poor quality of food at the Presby cafeteria motivates me to pack my lunch every day and save my money for better culinary uses."
neg,"Farmers markets here in AZ seem to be more of a craft fair.  Very limited in the produce department.  But what they do have is good and those working their booths are polite and helpful.  Like the tamales.  Tasty variety.  Parking was the pits, but it seems they've modified that situation a bit."
pos,"After my son had been to VIP many times he finally convinced me to go. I had a really great time, its a we'll run and efficient place just didn't realize how much energy it took for the 4 hr ""window"" which  is plenty of time to have a great time there. Have since recommended it to friends and neighbors and all have had great bday parties or individual sessions too. I'll be back again soon."
pos,"My wife and I were in town for 4 nights and on the last night we ate there with another couple. It was by far the best restaurant we ate at and we only eat at top rated restaurants. Everything we had was creative, fresh and properly seasoned.

Our favorites were the peppers, pate, spring roll and lamb dish! Also we had some wonderful local red wine! Next time I'm in town I will definitely include a visit to FbB!"
neu,"I wanted to wait until I've had the tinted/UV-filtered film on my windows for a full month or two & into Nevada's scorching Summers before I posted a review, but for the heck of it I'll do review now & update it as necessary.

  I called them on an early weekday afternoon in April & they told me they could fit me in if I arrived around 3PM.   I did so, and spoke with the young woman in-person about what all I wanted done.   Like most people, my main interest was in helping keep the interior of my car cooler during the hot summers here in the Las Vegas area.   My Chevrolet 'crossover' type car already had tinted side windows, read hatch glass, and sunroof & moonroof windows so my thought was I just needed something for the front driver & passenger side windows.      However, she educated me that the factory tinting really just provides some privacy, not UV protection, so even though most of the glass on the car was tinted, if I wanted to decrease UV penetration to keep the car interior cooler, I'd need to chose one of several brands & levels of UV protection film for the factory tinted-windows, and the I could also have a tinted+UV protected film put on the front driver/passenger door windows & a non-tinted UV film put on the front windshield.

  Having all the windows done cost me about $330 -- more money than I was planning on, but there is a lot of glass on my vehicle.    I got small discount for checking-in to the business on Yelp, but had I known I'd be going there sooner for the service, I would have looked for other coupons.

 I was told it should take about 90 minutes to do the work, so I sat for a while in their nice little customer waiting room with a wall-mount 30"" TV, some assorted magazines, and what especially was a nice touch -- a small refrigerator full of bottled water & soft drinks, free for their waiting customers.       Alas, some dumb ____ was engrossed in watching The Kardashians on the TV, so after about 30 minutes of trying to ignore it, I was either going to beat on the woman, or I needed to leave.  I opted to spend the next hour walking around the industrial park that the business is located in (Diablo Business Park!).  Not very scenic, but good exercise.    I returned a little over 90 minutes since they'd taken possession of my car, but it was not ready yet, so I went back into their waiting room & thankfully, the dumb broad had left so I was able to put the TV onto something more interesting.    Finally after about 2 hours, my car was done.

  They'd kept the interior of my car clean, gave me a quick briefing on the film (it's all on the inside of the car windows -- be careful not to scratch the film if cleaning the inside, any little bubbles you see should disappear within a day or so, etc.) & sent me on my way.

   It's so nice having the front side windows tinted, to make it much more difficult for a punk to walk by my car & casually glance in to see if there's anything valuable inside, and the tinting matches the OEM GM tinting.    If you've got good vision & look hard, you can & will be able to slightly detect that there's (UV blocking) film on the front windshield, but you really have to try to do it, and it's nothing that creates a safety issue or even just a mental nuisance.


   I usually park in garages during my daily travels, and as I write this, it's still just early May, but in the month or so that I've had the window tinting & more importantly, UV protection added to my car, we've certainly had plenty of very sunny days & temps into to upper 90s and I do believe the UV protection done at Eco-Tint has made a noticeable difference in my car staying noticeably cooler when parked outside or when I'm driving it.     The 110 degree days of July & August will be the true test, and I'm certainly not expecting I'll be able to drive around without the AC on, I'm just hoping & expecting the interior will stay somewhat cooler when I do have to leave the car parked out in the sun as well as the CA having to work less hard when I'm driving on those hot Summer days.

  So far, the window film is holding-up well -- no scratches, peeling, bubbles, etc.   I will edit this review at any point in the future when I have further info --good or bad-- to share."

Just 2 years ago I lived in the area and would come to Dixons at least twice a week and the food was outstanding! Last weekend we decided to venture down here for a long overdue visit and I was excited to get one of my favorite meals.

What a disappointment. Their food has taken a serious downgrade. Everyone at our table was disappointed with their meals. What started as A+ pub meals now looks like middle school cafeteria food.

The only positive was that the service is still excellent."

neg,"Oh My Gosh!!! This place was soooooooo disgusting!!  First of all to pay 11+ for a 6"" sub and French fries, was highway robbery.  Just sayin

I have a hard time believing some of the reviews for this place.  I don't see how you could like their so called Italian even remotely good.  You must have never had a sub sandwich in your life.  On the board the sandwich ingredients included, your regular meats, ham, cappicola, salami, etc etc.   The sub I got included the following.... black forest ham (maybe?? - it honestly tasted like store bought store brand ham) and COTTO SALAMI!!! It was so thick that is all you tasted.  I will never go back and eat here.

As my friend and I were waiting for our food, we thought what a great time to try a slice of pizza as their special was .99 for a slice.  We asked the girl at the counter,( who, by the way also had her two children at the counter as well....weird, yes.) for a slice and she said.... oh, we don't have any...  HUH?  

It was not a good experience.... DO NOT GO HERE...IT SUCKS!!!!.  There are other places for desperation food for a lot less in walking distance than to enter here. 

this is one of those places that you could definitely earn the Maverick badge.... hahaha

Thanks for reading."
neu,"My husband and I decided to come here for date night on a Saturday. We didn't have to wait for a table (actually the place was pretty quiet for a Saturday night) - I thought that maybe it's because the restaurant is tucked away. I ordered the baseball cut top sirloin and my husband ordered the Denver cut NY striploin. The sides of mashed potatoes and corn on a cob came with both meals as there are no other choices for sides. I added 2 large crunchy onion rings on top of my steak for an extra $4.00. The food presentation was bare and the steaks were underwhelming (the sear on the striploin was good, crunchy and not too much fat. I would rank this place just a tad higher than Jack Astor's and not even close to the Keg (and the Keg is not even that great). If you're a drinker, this place does have a large selection of beer, whiskey and bourbon. The décor is trendy with a wine wall and large TVs. I wouldn't come back here for steaks though..."
neu,"Petite Potato was quiet during my afternoon weekday visit. Service was good and the food and drink we ordered came out at a reasonable time. 

A good place to chill out and meet up with friends. The menu is extensive. Picking just one item could be quite difficult, but I can always come back on another day. I do love the options of both traditional Chinese dessert and other new and funky creation.

Pricing is typical of Taiwanese Tea House. A little pricey but you do pay for the nice ambience."
neg,"Nope! Never again. I went in this morning for a fill and a pedicure. The young lady who did my pedicure must have been having a bad day because she looked annoyed that I required her to work. No hello or conversation. I had selected 2 gel colors and had asked for those same colors in regular polish for my toes. That must have been to much. So needless to say I ended up with Orange toes instead of soft peach and teal and didn't stay for the fill. I will not be going back no matter how much of a discount I get. Customer Service is key, people."

So what I got for $10 white rice and curry. Make sure to add chicken for $3 cause if you don't read carefully u end up eating the rice with curry. That guy should have asked all customer if they want to add the chicken. 

Not worth it if is $10 lunch.I feel like I got scam.Should have get the sake lover for 12.99.
 The taste of the curry is ok but not worth the price."
pos,I came to university medical center for their transplant information. Was treated very well the person who took my who did my blood work was it was painless and fast. I had another appointment across the way in the Edwards building and they shuttled us to and from this building. The plus was the way that they have valet parking which is free to those with handicap Plates
neg,"We've seen several shows at Standup Live. Some comedians are funnier than others, obviously. Depends on the type of humor you're into. The drinks are pricey, and with a two drink minimum, you're going to spend some money even if you get a free ticket. The food is decent. My advice is to show up early: at least an hour. 

Okay now for the rub. As an audio engineer, I am shocked and horrified how terrible the sound system is. I've arrived late and sat in the back most times, and have a tough time understanding what's being said. Either the speakers suck, the mic sucks, or the audio engineer has no clue what they're doing. Only low and medium frequencies are getting to the back of the room. For the prices they charge for admission and drinks, and the quality of talent they bring to represent downtown Phoenix, they are definitely making enough grip to get a decent sound system. The audio has been super disappointing every time I've gone.

Edit 2 months later: the business contacted me about this review and told me I would be getting contacted by the manager. That never happened."
neg,Ticket prices are really cheap came out to about $22 per person. That includes one alcohol drink and a two for one coupon to the flavors buffet. When we got to the show we were informed that Mac King would not be performing and some other magician was taking his place. He really wasn't very good and the show was supposed to be over an hour and he finished in 54 minutes. Yelp had a check in offer for a free autographed picture of Mac King of course we could not get that since he was not performing!!! They need to tell us upfront if he is not performing not after-the-fact! I would have not gotten the tickets if I had known that
neg,"I had them install a surround sound about seven years ago.  The installation was okay, but they were constantly changing show times for the days of the installation.  To be fair they were in the process of changing locations.  However, when you tell a customer the times that you will be there as well as a time of completion every effort should be made to honor that.  I say this now to add to my most recent experience.  My sub-woofer went out and I ask them if they could come by and take a look at it.  They came by and picked it up.  Two days later with no word from them I called and they said that they would check on it.  They called me back and told me that they don't carry that brand anymore and that they would have to send it to the company for a repair estimate.  I then received a bill for $125.  While I was expecting a small charge, that seems a little excessive for a pick-up and we cannot do anything.  I think you could find better service and prices somewhere else.  I'm taking my business elsewhere."
pos,"The figures are so realistic that you might apologise to them if you accidentally bump into one thinking it's a person! ;) The quality of them is very impressive and they're all original dimensions so you can see how you size up to your favorite celebrities. This is a cool place (literally) to visit if you're looking for an alternative to casinos and buffets but don't want to leave the strip. It's a bit awkward to find but once you do, it's fairly cheap to get in. I think it's $15 with a NV ID and $25 without, but it's worth it. I originally wasn't planning on coming here but once I did, I've been back twice with different people. There is such a large variety of wax figures and photos are encouraged.There is also a replica wedding chapel from the ""Hangover"" movie and a costume dress that makes for some good fake Vegas wedding photos. If you're into wax museums, this place is awesome. If you've never been to a wax museum, I'd definitely check this one out, if any."
neg,I visited for happy hour and the waiter forgot two things on our order and was slow. The food was ok on happy hour drinks were good. Then I visited for dinner and the food was average and overpriced.
neg,"The food was good but service was horrible. We were there for a birthday party and one of the kids did not receive her food with the rest. The waiter didn't even notice that a meal was missing. We had to tell him. By the time her food came out everyone was done. It took longer to receive her quesadilla than it took to bring our initial meals. How long does it take to make a quesadilla? Did he even bother to expedite since it was their screw up? We kept seeing all this other food come out but not the quesadilla. It isnt even busy. Also, check if your customers need refills. There's a thought."
pos,"This place is eggcelent. I really like what they've been bacon. The cof(fee) wasn't bad either for the meal. The wait staff was abso-fruitly great and peary helpful. All in all, I would definitely be syr(up) for another visit. I'm glad I could yelp you to decide to eat your next breakfast.

Seriously though, this place is amazing. Possibly the best breakfast I've ever had. My favorite place to get breakfast in Montreal."
pos,The food was amazing and huge I love this place have no complaints the customer service was awesome I would recommend this place to a friend
pos,Absolutely love this place. I've never had anything from the menu that I didn't like. Been here at least 10 times now
pos,"I love hot dogs. Full disclosure, even as a kinda foodie, hot dogs rank in my top five favorite foods. I've had them everywhere that they serve them, from New York to Chicago, Happy Dog is still by absolute my favorite. The ambiance, the selection of beers the surplus of toppings.... it is hot dog nirvana. Go there and enjoy yourself!"
neu,"Went for restaurant week with some friends.  Service takes a while.  The guy helping us did the best he could but I think he was held by the kitchen, etc.  Anyways they ran out of a bunch of stuff on the restaurant week menu.  It's not we were there really late.  I think if you offer these things you should have them in stock.  Needless to say we were told about these missing items after we had already ordered making our wait longer.  In total 3 hour dinner.  Way too long.  Also food was ok except the fish which was very tasty"
neg,It doesn't accept visa credit card I had to run across to supermarket to get cash. Food portion was super small. I ate two orders by myself. A waiter almost took away my plate without asking before I finished.
pos,"The closest this southern boy has ever been to Paris is the one in Florida... at EPCOT. I did have three years of French in high school however,  so I knew that ""patisserie"" meant ""bakery"" (sorta) which means fresh croissants, macaroons and lots of other sweet, buttery and flaky treats. So on a sunny Saturday morning, my wife and I ventured to the Southend area of uptown Charlotte to try this place for ourselves. According to my fellow Yelpers, it appeared to be a slam dunk.

We were greeted by the actual chef, who allegedly worked for Oprah... not so sure about that but he did have a French accent  and the chocolate croissants were supreme. They ran about $4 each. We also purchased a small chocolate birthday cake with buttercream icing. It was moist and delicious.

The store itself is tiny. There is room for a couple of two-seater tables but little else. They're also tables outside. The cafe-like atmosphere is very appealing and, most importantly, the display case, although small, has all of expected French pastries.

In Charlotte, when you mention French bakeries, the first one that pops into your head is usually Amelie's, which unfortunately has franchised itself all over Charlotte, and it has lost some of its appeal. With Renaissance, it's all about the pastries. We enjoyed it and look forward to its move to South Park."
neu,"Service is very poor !!!
There's more employees then costumers and only one guy is on the hot line .
Order came completely not by the order it was ordered and it took forever considering the fact that there was one table when I set down .
It's a shame because the food was alright for the price .
Definitely needs a manager to bring some order into this place !!!!"
neg,"So upset and stressed over the multiple different answers when you leave a phone message for your MD...Dr. Manuel wrote my prescription on Dec. 20,2017. Unfortunately, all local Pharmacies were out of stock until January 2018. I took my written prescription to my Pharmacy who 8 hours later told me they couldn't fill it unless the Dr. faxed in an ICD CODE...a new requirement per the Pharmacy and Medical Office who both state they had no advance notice about this new rule until yesterday. I called the MD three times today to ask if they could flag the request as urgent as I have been out of my meds for two weeks, I was treated well by the Medical Assistants that I spoke with. I made my final call at 4:50 pm to find out it wasn't done and the Pharmacy didn't answer the call so I can't do anything until tomorrow am!! To put a patient in this position is horrible!!! There needs to be a way to resolve this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!'"
pos,Had such a great experience and got the cutest frames! Tyson was so helpful and made sure everything was perfect before I left with my new frames. Highly recommend!
neg,I loved eat n park. Such a fun place to go and eat. But taking down the molten lava cake is a bad move. But making matters worse and replacing it with a brownie Sunday or whatever is so bad. You can get that at any restaurant. Very disappointed. #bringmoltenlavacakeback
neg,"I usually go to BWW when traveling for good service at the bar.  Not this place no bartender behind bar. Waited for drink every time and waited to get the bill paid.  Very dissatisfied. Bar was full with a lot of empty glasses. 
Feel sorry for bartender he was serving tables and trying to bartender.  Don't call yourself a sports bar if you cannot provide quality service."
neg,If I could give this 0 stars I would.  The sushi looks unappetizing and the coloring is extremely off.  It tastes like they have all been out for a long time.  Worst sushi in Charlotte; this place will not be open long hopefully.
pos,"Doesn't receive enough credit on Yelp! The portions ARE MASSIVE. If you want to be in a breakfast/brunch coma all day, this is where you go. There's usually a line, but it'll be worth it! 

The quality of food for the price you pay was amazing! Service was great, everyone was friendly and inviting. The menu has a large variety to choose from, so you're bound to find something for you! 

There wasn't a long wait time when receiving our food. Dishes were flavourful and everything complemented each other very well. Absolutely no complaints about this breakfast spot, aside from Toronto needs one!"
neg,"If I had the time to take a look at the reviews of this restaurant I would not have eaten here for dinner on a Sunday night. This place was chosen by one other person in our group during our stay in Toronto for Labor Day weekend. As my boyfriend, sister, and my sister's boyfriend arrived we were seated in the same section at a separate table as our group. 

Our waitress was nice as she took our orders and even made suggestions on what to order. My table waited for our food and observed the other waiters as they brought out dishes to the other tables. We couldn't help but notice that every time someone brought out a different plate, they either looked confused and asked another worker which table the dish was suppose to go to or walked to a table only to bring the food back to ask another worker where it was suppose to go. And it wasn't one waiter that looked like they were being trained on the first day of the job. There were three workers (two males and one female) who all brought out food and looked confused. This worried us a bit but we decided to put it aside.

When we saw one of the waiters bring out a plate that my table assumed was ours we watched as he walked towards us, stopped at our table, and faced away to not only ask our waitress (who was taking orders of the table next to us) which table this dish was for BUT also slapped the waitress's butt multiple times as if he was trying to bounce a basketball. The waitress just laughed and pointed behind her towards us and said that the dish belonged to our table.

It didn't stop there. When my sister received her plate of Honey Sriracha wings she immediately noticed that her dish smelled like dried saliva. We smelled her dish and noticed that her wings smelled fine but it was her plate that smelled as if it had not been washed thoroughly and that a dog had licked the plate clean. 

There was also another incident where I leaned forward to get a bite of my fish & chips and one of the male waiters walked by and swiftly grabbed one of the empty water glasses that was placed close to my plate and had almost hit me in the face. He didn't even say excuse me and swiftly walked away. I understand there was a huge party that they had to wait, however the ill mannerisms was unacceptable. 

This place was truly worse than any other restaurant I have ever been to and I only wish I had looked on yelp for their reviews prior to stepping foot in the restaurant. As we left the restaurant I saw a group of three people standing outside debating if they should eat at this restaurant. I straight up told them to not waste their money on this restaurant's service nor food because what we experienced was something no one else should go through."
neg,"Pricey, small portions and food is not that great. I went for Carnival Enchiladas. Both enchiladas were very small."
neu,"WARNING WARNING WARNING!!!!

This is a ""millennial"" Gym...

What does that mean?

Today, all in one moment in time, 5 benches in/near the free-weight area were occupied by people just sitting, using their phones.  Trust me, well beyond the ""in between sets"" rest period. At the top of the stairs, someone was on a phone call while on the sit-up board. This is not unusual and happens ALL the time.

No member of the staff has EVER said Hello to
Me...EVER.

I would have given 'two stars' but, the gym is good sized with a decent selection of equipment. 

The front is beautiful and will be exceptional when the doors can be opened for open-air workouts, but beyond the frontage of the gym, the area surrounding is a dump.

C'mon guys, you could be SO MUCH better!"
pos,"A couple friends decided to try out MindSpark's Escape Rooms after having an awesome experience at Class Axe and we were not disappointed. As usual, Chris was amazing and got our group pumped up for the room. He was even kind enough to reassure one of our friends who was a little nervous about how scary the room would be. We were told it was one of the hardest rooms in Arizona and were so excited when our group beat it, although looking back, it could have been Chris being very gracious and stroking our egos  Great room and great fun! We're planning on returning to try out their other escape room!"
