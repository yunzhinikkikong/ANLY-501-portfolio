```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(kableExtra)
```

This is an R Markdown document that shows the process of cleaning the Recalls, Market Withdrawals, Safety Alerts Data. You can find the raw data set on the below link:

* [Recalls, Market Withdrawals, Safety Alerts](https://github.com/yunzhinikkikong/ANLY-501-portfolio/blob/master/Recalls%2C%20Market%20Withdrawals%2C%20%20Safety%20Alerts%20%20FDA.csv)


#### Read the CSV file

```{r message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
# read the CSV file into R
alert<-read.csv("Recalls, Market Withdrawals,  Safety Alerts  FDA.csv",header = TRUE,skip=1)
```

#### Subset the data set Based on the product type

Since the initial data set's product type includes food, drugs, medical device, etc. I will only keep the food section here. Note that, the "food" I mentioned here only includes human food, pet food is excluded.

```{r message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
alert<-alert%>%filter(str_detect(alert$Product.Type,"Food")==TRUE)
alert<-alert%>%filter(str_detect(alert$Product.Type,"Animal")==FALSE)
# exclude the detailed information following behind the "food&beverage"
alert$Product.Type<-alert$Product.Type%>%substr(1,16)
alert$Product.Type<-factor(alert$Product.Type)
kable(alert%>%count(Product.Type))%>%kable_styling()
```

As you can see through the table above, there are still some product with intial category is not food & beverage, I will explore the product description to double check.

```{r message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
test<-as.data.frame(alert%>%filter(str_detect(alert$Product.Type,"Food & Beverages")==FALSE & str_detect(alert$Product.Type,"Food & Beverage")==FALSE))
```

There are 22 rows, by checking the product description, there is only one of them should be categorized as food, which is "Natural Herbal Coffee". I will rename the type of that and drop others.

```{r message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
keep<-as.data.frame(alert%>%filter(str_detect(alert$Product.Description,"Natural Herbal Coffee")==TRUE))
alert<-alert%>%filter(!(str_detect(alert$Product.Type,"Food & Beverages")==FALSE & str_detect(alert$Product.Type,"Food & Beverage")==FALSE))
alert<-rbind(alert,keep)
```

Now the updated data set only has Food & Beverages, therefore I will delete the variable `Product.Type` in the new data set

```{r message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
alert.food<-alert[,-4]
kable(head(alert.food))%>%kable_styling()
write.csv(alert.food,"cleanedalert.food.csv", row.names = FALSE)
alert.food$Date <- as.Date(alert.food$Date, format="%d/%m/%Y")

## Tabulate
tab <- table(cut(alert.food$Date, 'year'))

## Format
df=data.frame(Year=format(as.Date(names(tab)), '%Y'),
           Frequency=as.vector(tab))

ggplot(data=df, aes(x=Year, y=Frequency)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", fill="steelblue")+
  theme_minimal()+
  ggtitle("Frequency of Food & Beverages' Recalls, Market Withdrawals, Safety Alerts")
```
