"negative","We've had the chicken wings, chicken parm (comes with spaghetti, salad, and bread), pizza, and meatball sub. They are all ""okay"". Plus, we think their prices are a bit high for what you get.

Just because they serve things other than pizza, do not mistake them for an Italian joint. Everything except the pizza tastes and likely is industrial food. I saw them take the salad dressing out of a mass-produced tub and the salad out of a ""Fresh Express"" bag. I'm assuming that the chicken parm and the wings came from matching frozen bags. I should have purchased some bags of my own and assembled everything at home. Sure, since I don't own a deep fryer, the chicken items wouldn't have that greasy, fried taste, but I would have saved the calories and the money. Also, the sub is mostly bread, and their bread is not good. Italian joints should not screw up bread.

Good things: we have always dined in, and the employees are nice. The restaurant and the kitchen are clean."
"negative","I've been here many times so after having a bad experience I naturally wanted to try it again and make sure it wasn't just an off night. I tried it 3 more times and all were bad, the quality of the sushi has definitely diminished. The sushi smells really fishy and it doesn't taste fresh. The last time I tried it I got really sick. 

Rolls I've had: Big Boss, Crunchy, Supper Spicy and Charlotte Roll. 

I am really disappointed as this was one of my favorite sushi places :o("
"negative","Well, we took our two schnauzers to Smelly Dog based on some great reviews on Yelp and from a guy with his own schnauzer in our apartment complex.  We were moving, and our regular groomer is out in Mesa... we chose convenience over excellence. Big mistake. 

We were able to get in for an appointment in a reasonable amount of time, the staff seemed fairly friendly, and I was in and out in just a few minutes. 

So, what was the problem?  I am pretty specific about how I like my dogs groomed, and I was clear with the groomer EXACTLY how I wanted them done (I could go into specifics, but I wouldn't want to be boring... suffice it to say that my list of requests was only about 3 items long).  Basically, NONE of the directions I gave were followed.  Not one.

Not only was my finickiness not satiated, but the basic schnauzer (and every other hairy dog) grooming items that should always be done without a specific request to do so were not done (ear plucking, anal glands expressed (yuck), shaved belly and between the foot pads).  I ended up doing these things myself over the course of the past few weeks. This does not please me, and it certainly doesn't please my dogs. 

In my almost 15 years of having a schnauzer groomed, I have never had a groomer blatantly ignore my requests AND give my dogs such a horrible basic groom.  I have never thought that my dogs were ugly before - but Smelly Dog managed to make them as ugly as two extremely cute dogs could possibly be.  I spent days literally crying about how awful they looked (these dogs are my babies). 

To add insult to injury, the groom cost $15 more per dog than my regular groomer. 

I will NEVER, EVER be going back to Smelly Dog. Ever. Ever. Ever. 

Instead, I will be tucking my tail between my legs and sheepishly returning to my regular groomer - Jennifer at Trim Time in Mesa.  She is the best groomer the pups have ever had. Worth the drive, worth the time, worth every penny."
"negative","I love Mexican food, and when I heard about this new restaurant I was STOKED! Cleveland needs more Mexican.

So I went to Los Habaneros very excited. The service was very pleasant, and attentive. This is always important. The space is comfortable, mainly booth sitting which to me is ideal. 

I like to test Mexican joints by ordering guacamole, the guacamole here is nothing spectacular. It was on the bland side and lacked much spice. It is very smooth, but that isn't the way I enjoy it best.

I'm vegetarian so it was a pleasure to see the vegetarian section on the menu. The selections are almost identical to that on the ""El Rodeo"" menu in Mayfield. My husband and myself each got one heaping order of a veggie selection, and we were fine with them. The beans are very creamy (is that a good way to put it??) in the sense that they are pouring out of the burritos when you take a bite. Sometimes they too struck me as bland. I wanted more spices, more...Habaneros maybe?

The servings are large, the staff is attentive and next time around I will try a margarita from the full bar. We'll return because of location and the authentic Mexican flair and the way it pleases my frequent cravings not to mention affordability!"
"negative","To all you Scottstitutes,

We've noticed that ever since Westgate opened, you've been quite the fixture at your modest, trendy over-priced hellhole of a strip mall. We really do appreciate your company, and we especially appreciate all of that fancy Scottsdale money you keep throwing at all the local businesses. But I'm getting the feeling that you're still not ""getting"" it. There seems to be some misunderstandings and misconceptions about Westgate, and I would like to take this opportunity to clear some of them up for you.

1) I don't care how expensive your meal or that new pair of Pumas was, you're still on the west side. Hence all the CHAINS. That 40 dollar bottle of face cream your girlfriend just got could've been bought at Arrowhead Mall. 

2) This is NOT your neighborhood. Don't let the condos and 12 dollar appetizers fool you. One step outside of the parking lot and you're in the fucking jungle, my friend. And the jungle is a ""no popped collar"" zone. I've looked into it. 

3) While some of the businesses may seem to have been imported from Scottsdale, the uninspired employees who work at these establishments are definitely not. You may have noticed that when you try to park in certain public spaces by the stadium, you'll be approached by grizzled men in ""parking staff"" shirts demanding that you pay them to park in ""their"" area. Or that when you complain to the waiter that your meal is being rained on by a leaky pipe, he just laughs and offers you a napkin. This is the west side, sucka. As Dracula once said, ""our ways are not your ways"".

4) While the tragically underdressed plebians and their families roaming the strip mall may be unsightly and crude, the fact is THEY LIVE HERE. 

5) Don't bitch about how happy hour is so crowded. This is the only time that the aforementioned locals can afford to eat at all these fine establishments. 

6) If the piano bar on the second level charges you a cover, it's probably because they don't think your girlfriend is all that hot. Or because you don't have one in the first place. Oh, burned by the doorman!

7) If there's a wait to get a table at Yardhouse, the last thing you should do is walk back and forth by the patio waiting for a table to magically open up. It only entices those with a table to order more booze and keep their table longer. 

8) If you're afraid of clowns or people in stilts, don't go to Margaritaville before a game/concert. They can sense your fear and will only use it against you.

9) While it may be tempting, do not make out on the escalator, no matter how hard the mood strikes you. There is a 80 percent chance that some teenager is running as fast as fast as he can to go in the opposite way on the one you're on. 

10) If you're going to ask me what time it is, at least have the common fucking sense to hide your watch. if you can't figure out what I am, then you can stand by the restrooms and see which one I go into, like all the other sane people do.

Thank you/go fuck yourself,
Jetta"
"negative","Almost 2 hours for delivery. Driver couldn't get in gate but never used directory to look up my name? I called and they apologized and gave me a credit for a future order (which was nice). But eating dinner after 10 pm = not fun."
"negative","I had really high hopes for this Chinese food after seeing how many reviews it had I decided to give it a try. I ordered take out General Tos chicken it was sour and soggy, the lo mein noodles where spaghetti noodles with no flavor, and the crab Rangoon was also very sour and not creamy. Additionally if I pay $11 for chicken, I would hope there would be more than 10 pieces. The service was great and I had a pleasant conversation with whomever checked me out but the food was sub par and I don't think I will go back."
"neutral","I met a friend her for pre dinner drinks, and I really wasn't very impressed. The decor is cool and modern, and perhaps it would have been different had I come for a meal and sat in the dining area.

We decided to sit upstairs in rooftop bar area, and because it was chilly, there wasn't much of a view. Also, they serve drinks in plastic cups up there (which I'm assuming is what they generally do), and I wasn't a fan.

I think I will come back for food next time and sit in the dining rooms. The drinks were good, and the atmosphere seems cool, so I will have to give it another try."
"neutral","Came here after work out. I a the first guest. The woman in service is really nice, kind of pushy though. She helped me with the pot and stopped me when I want to put cheese in it. There is a way of doing things.
I ordered the chicken+noodle+cheese+cabbage. Kind of spicy, but taste good. It is not healthy, but people need junk food at some point. 
The place is really cold, they say it is because they located in an old building. 
The side dishes are fair. Nothing surprising. 
I had to order 2 portions. It was huge, but I still finished it."
"neutral","Half hits, half misses. (And we tried a LOT of stuff.)

Hits: 
-Soft shell crab roll. Beautiful presentation, wonderful flavor. The aioli was really nice, and the crab was fried to perfection. 
-Bacon wrapped medjool dates. YES. MORE OF THESE. ALWAYS.
-Wild mushroom tacos. So good you won't miss meat. I echo the concerns of others that they are too small for the price...but I'm willing to pay whatever you demand for more.
-Miso eggplant. Delicate and creamy. Will make a believer even out of the most ardent eggplant hater. Perfect.
-Green magic mojito. This blended drink danced on my taste buds, but if you don't like your drinks herbaceous, go for something else.

Neither here nor there: 
-Guacamole with dried fruit. Decent guac but too much lime, needed more salt and a bit of heat, tomato, or onion flavor. At 11 bucks, it should really come with a couple extra chips instead of making you shell out for more.
-Rollo Chingon. Too much guac on top, but the adobo shrimp sushi was tasty and the roll was stunning to look at. Just take some of that extra avocado topping and smear it on your lotus root chip. 
-Coconut cocktail. Serviceable, but needed something to put it over the top. Couldn't really taste the lemongrass or lime. 
-Valet. You gotta. Ain't no way around it.

Misses: 
-Crispy pork belly roll. So aggressively salty. Could taste hardly anything it was so salty. Should have listened to some of the other reviewers on here and avoided it. 
-Korean beef taco. Salt lick central. So salty you couldn't taste anything else. Really a bummer. Also not traditional Korean beef like you'd get a Korean BBQ, but shredded.
-Head on giant shrimp. Shrimp is singular in this case. And dramatically overcooked. Inconsistent seasoning, with one bite rubbery shrimp and the next almost pure salt rub. The pureed garlic and halved cherry tomatoes were pretty insipid too. Don't waste your 14 bucks on one nasty shrimp.  
-Nightclub atmosphere. So necessarily loud."
"neutral","Was treated by my sister and bro-in-law to an outing here recently.  I was really looking forward to it, which if you read enough of my reviews I have huge issues fulfilling the prophecy.

The setting is beautiful.  Really.  6 or 7 stars worthy.

Service -- waiter was awesome, personable but not annoying.  Check-in, bartender, all excellent.  I don't think my water glass dipped below an inch all night.  The only slightly off thing was the bus boy (bus man?) trying to collect about 10 plates at the end of our meal, on a single trip, one plate stacked on top of the other.  I decided that he is secretly part of the circus and famous for carrying 20 plates at once. Great for the circus, slightly odd for a restaurant at this price point.

Our dinner party sat down for dinner about 8:15 pm.  Five people, apps, entree and a couple shared deserts, pacing was pefect but at 10:15 pm it was us and another table.  Is this odd?  Is this really an early bird special- type place? I don't know.  Why am I mentioning this?  Not sure.

I had the crab cake appetizer, very good, but served with a dollop of guacamole on top.  The guac was delicious but I just thought it was an odd combination.  I feel like an asshole.  

For the entree I had the veal wrapped in proscuitto, cooked medium rare as recommended by the chef.  The outside sear on the meat was perfect.  Really.  I felt like I finally understand what celebrity chefs are talking about on the food network when they mention a ""perfect sear"".  However, the rest of the meat, eh.  Felt like I was chewing rubber bands.  I feared that I might knock my plate off the table trying to cut it.  I don't eat veal often (read: maybe once before if that).  Considering there are starving children in Africa -- hell, right down the street, I feel like an asshole for complaining about a $35 undercooked?  overcooked?  incorrectly cooked? cut of veal.  

I could see myself returning for brunch on a special occasion but I'm not sure I would agree with some of the other raves here on Yelp."
"neutral","A very small restaurant but tasty food. The sauces and marinades are delicious! The chicken is a little dry. The Peri peri fries are so good! A little bit on the expensive side but you're getting fresh, hearty food."
"neutral","Ok, like, Bally's has some misleading signs.  They were advertising 'happy hour' at the pool from 4-8...which included 1/2 priced drinks.  Too bad the bartender looked at me like I was crazy when I asked him about it!  I think he felt sorry for us and just hooked up the deal anyway.  Drinks here are $12!  Totally NOT worth the full price, but if you're lucky enough to score the 1/2 priced deals, THEN it's a pretty good special!  

The pool was surprisingly empty around 5 on the Sunday before Labor Day!  Where was everyone?  Hmmm.  They have private cabanas you can rent, which was really nice and very Miami-esque.  The music, though, I could kinda do without.  Too much house/techno for that early in the day.  More hip-hop please."
"neutral","Mediocre cheesesteaks.  Nothing much else to say.  Bleh.  I've had better cheesesteaks at airports around the country.  I'm sure people only eat here because of the location."
"positive","I had a blast here. It's huge and gorgeous. Very expensive but you get what you pay for. Next time I head to Vegas I'm totally coming back here. The confetti cannons are cool and light effects. Seriously, such a great time to be had here."
"positive","I can't say enough good things about this place. My most recent stay here was this weekend, but I have been a long time patron of this hotel/casino for years. 

First, let's start with the rooms. The rooms! My goodness! The best way I can describe them are that they are comfortable and clean, which in my opinion are the two most important traits that any hotel room must have and Monte Carlo hits them both. The standard deluxe room is just that...standard. But that's okay because you don't come to Las Vegas just to stay in your room all day, you go out and have a great time! It's functional with the most basic and necessary amenities you need in a room: a bathroom, a comfortable bed, TV and closet space. Any more than that is just extra icing (again nothing wrong with that). 

The check-in process was relatively easy. For such a long line at 5:30 PM I didn't have to wait long. Most of the desks are were open and I was in the line less than 15 minutes and checked in and on my way to my room in less than 5 minutes. 

Monte Carlo also boasts a number of eating establishments that range from fast food to first class dining. The fast-food places are conveniently located right by the elevators and if you're in the mood for a higher end dining experience, Monte Carlo offers that as well. 

One of the main reasons I stay here is because I very much enjoy playing at the Monte Carlo. They have many of the newest slot machines and some of my old time favorites. The table games are exciting and welcoming. The dealers are first rate and are friendly. They are professional and personable and will take the time to answer question about the nuances of the game should you have one. 

Monte Carlo Hotel and Casino is and will always be my go to hotel when I come to Las Vegas. The location is great, the rooms are clean and comfortable and the employees who work here are the best. You can have your modern (and in my opinion) sterile new fancy hotel rooms. I'll stay at Monte Carlo and enjoy it's charm. 

Till next Yelp!"
"positive","It's all about the value and taste with this Vegas affordable eatery!   Large 16'' pie with meatball feeding my family of four for $20.   That's $5 a piece for feeding all of my family ... Not 4 burgers for $71 plus tax and drinks and fries etc.   Vegas will reach into your pockets for everything and anything you want when it comes to separating you from your money.  Finding a place like this that will feed a family of four for 20 bucks is a rare treat in this city!"
"positive","Huge clearance selection, scored a few workout items for more then half off! 
Don't throw your free panty coupon ladies they take expired ones."
"positive","With the price and location it is a steal!!  Of course the beds aren't as comfy as the next hotel on the strip, but for the price, whose to complain?!

I've always gotten a corner room so it's VERY VERY LARGE, SO MUCH EXTRA SPACE, and I don't have to deal with an extra set of neighbors for the weekend =P.

Another plus is that RIGHT OUTSIDE is the place with the yard long margaritas!! JACKPOT!! =D"
"positive","I visited The Groves Bar and Grill in Gilbert, AZ with my husband and friend on a Friday night. We were greeted by a hostess who seated us promptly. There was some enjoyable live music playing when we arrived but unfortunately it ended shortly after our arrival (just after 9pm). 

Our server was friendly, but shared that it was only his 4th day, so he wasn't as knowledgeable about the menu as we would have hoped. We started with the chips and salsa; pretty basic, but not bad. My friend and I ordered the ""Backpacker"" pizza. The menu indicated that one of the toppings was kalamata olives. We asked the server to only put the olives on one half, when it came out there were just plain green olives on half (and we later realized that we had been charged $1 to ""add olives""). We asked our server if the 12"" pizza was a ""two-person"" pizza and he recommended that we go with the 16"" saying we might even have some leftovers. The pizza came LOADED with tons of fresh veggies, but after 2 pieces each, we were stuffed and ended up taking half of it home. The 12"" would have been plenty. The pizza crust was light and fluffy. The fresh veggies could have been cut up smaller; they were quite large and made eating the pizza a bit more work, but overall the pizza was delicious!
 
My husband wasn't hungry when we went, so he got the Chicken Fried Steak to go. He ordered it with a baked potato; it also came with broccoli and a nice sized side salad. The balsamic vinaigrette dressing was good. Good size portions. He said it was alright, probably would have been better if he would have eaten it in the restaurant, rather than to-go. Overall, our server was extremely friendly and attentive, often checking in with us to see how our food was and if we needed drink refills.  The owner stopped by our table and encouraged us to check out the outside patio area. The patio area outside looked really nice; we may have to sit out there next time we visit. Overall experience was very good; we'll definitely go back!"
"positive","Love it! Really into vintage rock and they played all the hits. Bon Jovi , KISS, Pink Floyd, AC/DC and so much more."
