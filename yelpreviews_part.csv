MhfebM0QIsKt87iDN-FNw,2,"As someone who has worked with many museums, I was eager to visit this gallery on my most recent trip to Las Vegas. When I saw they would be showing infamous eggs of the House of Faberge from the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts (VMFA), I knew I had to go!

Tucked away near the gelateria and the garden, the Gallery is pretty much hidden from view. It's what real estate agents would call ""cozy"" or ""charming"" - basically any euphemism for small.

That being said, you can still see wonderful art at a gallery of any size, so why the two *s you ask? Let me tell you:

* pricing for this, while relatively inexpensive for a Las Vegas attraction, is completely over the top. For the space and the amount of art you can fit in there, it is a bit much.
* it's not kid friendly at all. Seriously, don't bring them.
* the security is not trained properly for the show. When the curating and design teams collaborate for exhibitions, there is a definite flow. That means visitors should view the art in a certain sequence, whether it be by historical period or cultural significance (this is how audio guides are usually developed). When I arrived in the gallery I could not tell where to start, and security was certainly not helpful. I was told to ""just look around"" and ""do whatever."" 

At such a *fine* institution, I find the lack of knowledge and respect for the art appalling.",2015/4/15 5:21,2015
lbrU8StCq3yDfr-QMnGrmQ,1,"I am actually horrified this place is still in business. My 3 year old son needed a haircut this past summer and the lure of the $7 kids cut signs got me in the door. We had to wait a few minutes as both stylists were working on people. The decor in this place is total garbage. It is so tacky. The sofa they had at the time was a pleather sofa with giant holes in it. And my son noticed ants crawling all over the floor and the furniture. It was disgusting and I should have walked out then. Actually, I should have turned around and walked out upon entering but I didn't. So the older black male stylist finishes the haircut he was doing and it's our turn. I tell him I want a #2 clipper around the back and sides and then hand cut the top into a standard boys cut. Really freaking simple, right? WRONG! Rather than use the clippers and go up to actually cut the hair, he went down. Using it moving downward doesn't cut hair, it just rubs against it. How does this man who has an alleged cosmetology license not know how to use a set of freaking clippers??? I realized almost immediately that he had no idea what he was doing. No idea at all. After about 10 minutes of watching this guy stumble through it, I said ""you know what? That's fine."", paid and left. All I wanted to do was get out of that scummy joint and take my son to a real haircut place.

Bottom line: DO NOT GO HERE. RUN THE OTHER WAY!!!!!",2013/12/7 3:16,2013

The fries are sometimes good and sometimes great, and the spicy dipping sauce they come with is to die for. The beer list is amazing and the cocktails are great. The prices are mid-level, so it's not a cheap dive you can go to every week, but rather a treat when you do. Try it out. You won't be disappointed!",2015/12/5 3:18,2015

The cashiers are pleasant and as far as food wise i have yet to receive any funky chicken. The clean up crew zips around the dining area constantly so it's usually well kept. My only gripe is the one fella with Red hair he makes the rounds while cleaning but no smile or personality a few nights ago he tossed the napkins i just put on the table to help go with my meal. After I was done he just reached for my tray no ""excuse me or are you done with that?""  I realize he's trying to do his job quickly but a little table manners goes along way.

The scone with clotted cream was divine!!!! The iced teas are very refreshing and I swear I drank a whole container myself both visits. 
The second time I had soup, salad and a sandwich. The salad had this amazing (raspberry? strawberry?, I forgot) vinaigrette. The sandwich was good, but I was kind of disappointed with the soup. It was potato and tasted too ""milky"". 
They change the menu often and now have a tea inspired one. Can't wait to go back and try it.

I discovered this place from the front desk of the airport hotel and they recommended it highly. I called to place my order for Delivery to my room. They were very accommodating.

Won Ton Soup - nice broth and tender won tons.

Chicken with Diced vegetables and Cashews - again, fresh vegetables were used, and good sized pieces of chicken.

Crispy Beef - much like a Ginger Beef, nice serving of Beef with a sweet chilli sauce. Very tasty.

Broccoli in Garlic sauce - came with peppers,Onions , Broccoli was not over done.

oVuZtlCFg_zF090Nhtp0Ow,4,"A close friend was in town and so instead of taking him to a more well established joint, we decided to try the newly opened Choolah. We were not disappointed.

I am a bit of an amateur chef myself and consider my palate to be fairly sophisticated when it comes to all kinds of South Asian cuisine. This is not authentic Indian food - we don't have rice and salad bowls - but it is good, wholesome, high quality Indian food.

I ordered a bowl of rice, yellow daal and the koftas (meatballs). The daal was perfect, the way daal should be cooked. The koftas were a little bland for my taste, but otherwise not bad...soft and the right texture. Paired with the many sauces and onions and the whole dish was wholesome and rich and very filling. My friend ordered the biryani, which, while not bad, still isn't the way real biryani should be, and I come from a city known for its biryani - but then I still haven't found a single place in America that makes biryani the way they do it back home.

The ambiance is good and there's plenty of room to sit. The line moves quickly and at most you'll face a 10-15 min wait on a crowded day. The only issue I had was with the music - being a designer, it bothers me that the music selection to go with such great interiors  could have been better...I would expect Bollywood classics or Indian classical fusion instead of the usual loud pop music.

Tldr: if you're looking for authentically prepared and presented Indian food you'll be disappointed. If you're looking for high quality Indian-American food, this is a great place to get it. Will be coming back to try their tikka masala and chicken next.

Update: went there again with a bunch of friends and tried their chicken tikka masala and pav bhaji. This is hands down the best Indian place in Pittsburgh - the bhaji is to die for. Make sure you sprinkle lemon on top and have the pav with mango chutney.",2018/2/1 19:15,2018

Some weeks are good, fresh and saucy. Some weeks can be completely opposite. I never thought about writing a review until our experience last week. 
We ordered medium chicken wings and hot trifecta 2 lbs of shrimp. The wings came out SUPER spicy (probably hot) and the shrimp came out plain ( 99% butter and 1% spices). When we ordered we asked to make sure we have enough sauce but they came in almost dry. My husband and I love this place but we just never know what we will get that night.

My coworkers ordered, the Chicken Tacos for $11.99, Steak Tacos (Photos) for $11.49, Fish Taco for $10.99 and a cup of Chowder for $5.74. Add in a few IPAs, or soft drinks and we all averaged about $15 each.

I tried my friend Josh's Fish Tacos and his was great, too.  So why they Four Star review, Georgie? Well the non fish group thought theirs was average. Okay, so you go to a place called Coconut's Fish Cafe and you order chicken and steak?  I'm sorry, that is so LOL.

XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg,4,"As the previous person posted, what more can really be said about this restaurant. I just came back from Vegas this morning and a truly truly horrible experience.  I only went out there for a concert and the concert and this restaurant were the best parts of my trip.  I went in here accidentally, meaning, i had no clue it was Bobby Flay's restaurant. I was hungry and Caesars Palace was a across from where I was staying and all the restaurants in my hotel were packed and had lines, I walked right in with no waiting. (I will assume now that since its Bobby's place this place can get crowded so I feel the need to note this was a Sunday about 11:45am) Once inside Caesars Palace, I went to the first restaurant I saw, which was this one.  I realized mid-meal it was his restaurant when the waiter at the table next to me was explaining to the recently seated couple that ""Mr Flay likes a little spice so beware all of our dishes have a little kick"" (they were an older couple). I know i'm slow after he said that, that's when i realized why they had his cookbooks in the front. :)  (but like i said had a horrible trip so i wasn't even looking for things like this) anyway onto the food.

FOOD: fantastic.  I went on sunday and i got the eggs and aged striploin tortilla (fancy name for steak and eggs) and  it was yummy.  It came with all this spices of sorts (well they werent spices). I am not really sure how to describe it, more like the consistency of salsa's but they werent salsa's, at any rate it was really good mix with the eggs.  I had a side of home fries which were a little burnt but oh well.  The steak was very good, very flavored, moist and tender. Overall very good. Had a cappuccino too, also very good. I wish i had tried the crabcake's but i knew i wasnt going to eat all that. waiters were awesome, just the right amount of attentiveness. (I personally hate when waiters/waitresses, come back every 5 minutes, is everything ok is everything ok...sheesh can i enjoy my meal?) 

Anyway like i said, i had a horrible experience in vegas and this and the concert i went to see were the best parts about my trip, very glad i blessed up on this place.

P.S.  Take notice, i have never eaten in a celebrity chef's restaurant and noticed that there were no salt and pepper shakers on any table.  ha just a fun tidbit, i thought that was funny and very interesting, almost as if the chef is subtly saying ""you will not mess up my dish with your spices""",2009/10/13 9:50,2009
qUWqjjjfpB2-4P3He5rsKw,4,"In the heart of Chinatown, I discovered it enroute to Kensington Market one day. It's quite hard to see, if you don't know it's there. First experience was very positive - would definitely return!

ATMOSPHERE: Small space. Think Banh Mi Boys, and other trendy over-the-counter eateries. Vibe is casual. Free WiFi is nice.

SERVICE: Okay. Staff does their job, but not overly helpful upon entering the space. Maybe because it's an over-the-counter style place, but it would have been nice to be walked through their ordering process and menu.

PRICE: Average. Depends on the size of pizza you order.The small pizza ($7-9.50) is filling for one. Large size pizza ($13-18.50) is good for sharing... or one VERY hungry person.  Pasta portions are very generous for the price tag ($9-14)


FOOD: My friends and I were here for the first time, and we thought it was a pizza place so we all ordered pizza. It wasn't until we were waiting for the food to come, that we looked around and realised EVERY other table around us only had pasta on them. Guess we gotta come back to try! We did notice that the menu said their pasta is homemade. So will definitely come back.

Here's the pizza we ordered:

Peking Duck Pizza - Very tasty! Rich flavours that work well. But it's heavy, so come hungry - or order to share.

Margherita - Good, but not the best. I recommend trying the more ""special"" toppings instead.

It blows my mind because they can't possibly know alcohol laws if they don't know anything about the menu - going to bite that company one day.  I am not sure but I think someone I know told me they do the shared tip thing and I thought maybe that may be why but I know another place that does that and the service is excellent.  I don't know what the problem is - I have worked in the industry before while in college and I would say front of the house training needs big overhaul.

LkMtMHVetws5_7QfRjPtlg,2,"This actually used to be one of my favorite hotel/casinos back in the day.  Oh, how things have changed.

There are some goods, however.  If you are a conventioneer, you have instant and direct walking access to the main convention center.  But don't think about parking here for said conventions.  $30 a day for parking, Hilton?  Seriously?  That's robbery.  And greed.

The biggest disappointment is the killing off of Star Trek: The Experience over two years ago.  Despite this place being off-Strip, I made it a point to go here because they had such a fun and unique attraction here.  It would be one thing if they had something in mind to replace it, but either poor planning or the economy.... It's dead, Jim. 

The ""Space Lounge"" is still there.  An entire casino area with a heavy sci-fi theme to it.  Except there's no casino here.  It's a huge space themed area with a ghost town bar, no slots, a few couches, a makeshift stage, beer signs, and a few remnants of Star Trek themes.  All of this space, and nothing.  No life to it.  Couches and beer signs only make the emptiness and waste of the area seem more empty and pathetic.

With their main draw gone, what has replaced it as the headliner?  Benihana's.  Nothing wrong with the restaurant, but it's hardly unique or exclusive, even in Vegas.  The Hilton has a Pizza Hut Express here too.  Maybe they should promote that as their ""big draw"" on the marquee as well.  A huge Benihana sign covers up the old entrance to Star Trek.  With couches pushed in front of the entryway.  Again, just sad, and I'll be a big man in saying that they kind of broke my heart getting rid of one of my most beloved hang-outs here.

The arcade is dead as well.  Another blanketed off space that sits and collects dust.  Again, with two-plus years, no suitable replacement has been found for anything in this section.  A few shops that fluctuate, but that's it.  This is a lot of dead space to go unused.  

There's also the issue of the Men's bathroom in the main casino area.  Above every urinal is a picture of a lust-crazed girl staring over your bits with a camera, magnifying glass, tape measure, etc, while you pee.  The first time I saw this, it was ""ha ha"" funny, then when the laughter died, it just turned creepy and weird for me.  I actually selected a urinal based off which girl creeped me out the least.  She merely looked like she was casting spells at my nethers.  I could live with that.

Ladies: I must know.  Is there something like this in the girl's restroom?  When you close the stall door to do your business, is there a picture of some crazed guy making grabbing motions where your boobs would be?  Please message me and let me know.  I'd really like to know what the Hell you get in your bathroom after my gender's discovery.

As critical as I am being, there looks to be some sort of steampunk-themed club called ""Triumph"" there.  I want to check this out.  Atonement for the death of my beloved Warp Core Breach booze bowl?  We'll see, but it's going to have to be pretty good to replace the hole in my heart from that much booze for so cheap a price.

The sad part is, Hilton's one of those ""history rich"" casinos here.  Look up the history on this place.  A lot of awesome stars and vintage Vegas stuff happened here, which makes you wonder why this isn't represented more.

This place is great for convention visitors to stay, but that's about it as far as I can see.  They need to figure themselves out for everything else.",2011/1/9 0:09,2011

7EZ4Eu7YJ1ltRCC5jXFJrQ,1,"There wasn't one specific thing that made this buffet so horrible... It's just the accumulation of everything being less than average quality. There are plenty of options, but none of them were flavorful, hot, or worth filling up on.

Some others have commented on the dessert section being worthwhile, but to us everything tasted unthawed and on the stale side. The Asian section had probably the best offerings but all were still fairly bland.

The worst part is that when I was going to grab a slice from the pizza station, someone had placed the tongs directly on TOP of the pizza... So all the hand germs were in direct contact with the food! There were two workers right there who didn't think this was disgusting.. I would have discarded the slices.

My husband and I both left with unsatisfied stomachs and looked forward to the second dinner we would have a few hours later at a much better establishment.",2013/4/10 16:19,2013
_ZfjpSEO5ntk-1hbnwCR4g,3,"I stayed here back in April. Friday-Sunday. It's a nice hotel and the room had a great view. This is just another building that is part of the Palms. It has no casino and is just used for rooms. 

We had the two room suite with 3 bathrooms, and 2 full kitchens. The main bathroom had a huge shower. I swear you can fit around 12+ people if thats what you want to do ;) They also have a tub in the middle of the room so you can watch your girl take a bath? lol The place was beautiful but was it worth the $2000?? I'd say yes, but the only major downside is that it's far from the strip. Would I do it again? Probably not since you can get a nice suite for the same price at a nice hotel and be on the strip. Another downside was that you cannot go out onto the patio. They lock all the sliding doors. That was a big downside for me!",2012/8/15 1:33,2012

The staff was rather slow but the food was good so no complaints on that.

I had the southwestern omelette and I LOVED the salsa inside it was so yummy and really added a nice touch to the meal. Prices were also fair. I decided to branch out from my usual egg benny. It was a nice change.",2013/11/14 5:08,2013
YJ2Y_asLIlbo-uijVugLow,5,"As a spicy food fan, when I see a restaurant called Hot & Spicy, I add it to my must try list.

I decided to give Radica's a shot shortly after seeing the title of the restaurant. On first glance, the restaurant was super clean and new. A really nice environment for a fast food style joint! 
 
Between my fiance and I, we ordered two roti's - one spicy chicken and the other a medium goat roti. Oh boy, the roti's were awesome! Fresh, packed with flavor and actually spicy.  Portions were huge as well! 

We also tried a shrimp double. This was my first time trying a double. It was ok, but the real star of the show was the roti's.

If you're looking for genuinely good roti with a kick of spice, I'd say this is the spot!",2015/6/8 18:24,2015
9Eghhu_LzEJgDKNgisf3rg,3,"Was super excited to bring my boyfriend to this Scaddabush location after going to the Richmond Hill location months back with friends and have been craving their mozzarella balls ever since! 

We arrived and were seated at 8:15, and since reviewing the menu before hand, we placed out order with our waitress right away. We ordered the 'Naked' mozzarella to start and for mains the Penne Bolognese and Margherita pizza. 

The waiting game was okay, we got our appetizer about 25 mins of waiting. Once arriving, the first thing I noticed was how small the mozzarella ball was compared the he Richmond Hill location. However, it was delicious ! I was reminded on why I chose this restaurant for dinner. 

As for the mains, we waited and waited and waited. We had seen a male (possibly manager?) walk around with pizza slices and deliver them to some tables, however not ours. As he went to the table next to us we could overhear him apologizing for the wait time for their meals. 

At around 9:05 our meals did arrive. The pizza was good,  definitely not enough cheese but will do. My boyfriend did really like his pasta. 

Overall, I would say I would come back to Scaddabush. Possibly just for the mozzarella balls but as our mains were just okay and nothing special, wouldn't choose this location for a full dinner again.",2016/8/25 16:25,2016

Their drinks are very customizable and if you think it's not perfect even after you get it, you can get it adjusted. The service is super friendly and the aura is welcoming. It's a clean environment where all the senses are in for a treat though the mesmerizing smell from the freshly made crepes, the refreshing sip from their drinks, to the perfect texture of their boba.

nIIuxIn5RU0j-XkDWh3hlA,1,"Passed by here after we went to raijin ramen and thought everything looked super cute. Bought 3 bread, the charcoal salted egg, an almond croissant and a coffee walnut bread. All three, after discount came to almost 20$. I was quite excited but upon trying them all, the croissant was pretty good (but I've had better, ie nadege, etc) but the other two were very mediocre. The salted egg bread was very one dimensional as the bread itself wasn't very flavourful. I thought it would be closer to a moon cake concept where bread is a bit sweet and counterbalanced the salty egg yolk but instead the egg yolk overpowered everything else. The walnut bread was also very weird as the coffee had a weird after taste. 

For the price I would def not come back.",2018/10/4 14:12,2018

We were greeted by our server and he took our drink order. We started with the seafood platter which had shrimp, oysters, lobster tails and a crab mix. Love seafood? Get this for sure! The oysters were quite large and not amongst the freshest I've ever had but they were still good. 

For dinner we enjoyed the chicken and the scallops with a side if crab fried rice. Crab fries rice was full of flavor and really good! Scallops had a citrus flavor added which made it even more tasty. 

Service was above par as well. Our server was attentive and friendly.

l4ByLNdIcsjgnglB1aXQQQ,1,"I can't tell you how angry I am right now.  I went to Huntersville Ford yesterday to get an oil change on my commuter car.  Paid my $41.00 and was given back my car just over an hour later.
Today I had to go to work (40 mile round trip commute).  As I was getting off of I-85, I noticed the smell of burning oil.  I thought maybe the tech just spilled a little on the exhaust manifold since it's right there, and maybe it's burning off.  I didn't hit a stop light until I was almost at my office.  When I stopped and was waiting for the light, my cabin started to fill with smoke, and I had smoke pouring out from under the hood and the wheel wells as well.
I pulled over into the parking area of a gas station (because they have accessible fire extinguishers) and parked.  I popped the hood only to find THE TECHNICIAN DID NOT PUT THE OIL FILLER CAP BACK ON!!!  Now my engine is covered in potentially flammable oil, and of course Huntersville Ford is closed today!!!!
I have my car sitting outside in the parking lot with the hood open, just in case it decides to ignite, because my engine is pretty hot after a 20 mile drive.
I called and left a voicemail, and now I have to find a way to degrease my engine at work, just so I can drive it home in a less-flammable state.  I WILL HOLD HUNTERSVILLE FORD RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY COMPONENTS THAT FAIL AS OF A RESULT OF THIS.  Most electronics don't like being slathered in motor oil.  In fact, I'm pretty sure they aren't designed for that.

And NO, I did not have other work done... Just the oil change.  You had 1 job.... oil change.  No transmission service, no brake service, no rotation, no cooling flush... just an oil change.  I hope he remembered to tighten the filter, but I am skeptical at this point.

I can assure you, I will NOT be taking my car back to that dealership, even though it is right around the corner from my house.  MAKE IT RIGHT, HUNTERSVILLE FORD.",2018/4/15 14:54,2018

The chicken and pork tenderloin were outstanding.  This time, I ordered the following - duck crepe (SOOOO good!), shrimp tamale (very flavorful and fresh), salmon (mediocre, at best... and our waiter even told us not to order it... but my friend didn't listen), and halibut (tender, flaky, not fishy at all... and so flavorful!).  The halibut and appetizers were my favorites and I would definitely go and order those again.  We also ordered 3 desserts, which were totally worth it!  Sweet potato pudding (and I don't even like sweet potatoes!), Banana pie tart thingy, and spicy peanut chocolate cake.  mmmmmm would definitely go there for dessert and the appetizers!!!

The pizza is of better quality than most (a definate step up from Pizza Hut and Domino').  The thin crust is we like here.  The crust has a crunch to it, which I prefer.  Their menu has a ""tailgate"" variety of food (Pasta, Ribs, Fried Chicken, sub sandwiches......you get the picture).

The prices are bit high for what you get.  They do have specials so that is what our family typically goes for..... Familiy Feast ($22) includes 16' pizza with one topping, 6 wings, 4 garlic sticks, and 2 liter of pop.

My daughter's go to is a strawberry banana smoothie and the menu had a few smoothies that had strawberry and banana mixed with other stuff and I asked if they would be able to make one with just strawberry and banana and she had said they couldn't because it was already pre made. So we continued to look at the menu and a different girl came and said she would be able to make the smoothie so thank you to her. My husband and I knew we wanted to get an acai bowl so as
we looked at the different options we found one we wanted to try but on the menu it had a pitaya and we asked if we could get it with acai instead but again was told that it was already pre made. So we went with one that was made with acai but it had blueberries which we don't like and we weee hesistant to ask if they would be able to leave them out since everything seemed to be pre made but my husband did ask and luckily she said they could leave it out. Whew! It wasn't a long wait to get our order. My daughter drank her smoothie saying it was okay and our acai bowl was okay as well. To
me the best part was the granola and that's about it. At least we can say we finally tried this place and we definitely won't be back. We will be sticking to our usual spot Bowlology!",2018/5/8 16:50,2018

gc_GGat7TgNCmrgc4nVOgw,4,"Paid a visit here after the JT concert on Friday night - best decision all weekend. Every restaurant was packed before the show, so we set on wandering MGM afterwards for a good after show nosh and were definitely pleased at Crush. Luckily we were seated right away (not many people ordering dinner at 11pm I suppose!) and our incredibly nice server saw to our drink order ASAP.

The ambience is tres chic. Dark, romantic, and removed from casino craziness in the back where we sat cuddled up in a booth. The only negative about our seats was the pretty chilly draft, but perhaps we were just too sober ;) The Syrah was absolutely delicious, and at $11 for a glass, a Vegas bargain. We began with the Caesar salad which came out within minutes of ordering and was very tasty, though I myself found the sweetness to be a little strange. Overall it was a crunchy, refreshing delight. We then shared a margherita flatbread and the gnocchi. Whoa....both dishes definitely exceeded expectations. They were small plates, but really perfect for sharing. The speed at which the salad was delivered was slightly misleading, as the other dishes took quite a while to come out. However, they were clearly exceptionally fresh when they arrived.

Our waiter was pretty busy but as attentive as he could be, and very professional without being overbearing. The end-to-end experience was more than I expected at such a large venue, and thus deserves a high recommendation.

I was the same as Mel U.  I had been past this place a couple times and never thought to go in.  I think it may be because it's on the ""outskirts"" of town and a section I really don't go to often.  

First off I'll say I love the outdoor seating area!  It was a front row seat to all the furry watching action going on outside the Westin and convention center.  Plus let's face it, it's always great to have outdoor seating!  

Since they're known for their martini's I had to indulge!  I ordered the Cosmo-Tonic because for some reason I've been really into Cosmo's lately.  With all tini's, you really have to have the right mixture.  I hate when there's too much Cranberry or even too much Vodka (gasp, I know!).    This was a perfect mix I'm glad to report!

I didn't like the fact that they don't offer Padthai with flat noodles, but only with thin noodles... Took away from the whole Padthai eating experience that comes with the flat noodles and the flavors it generates. It was also extremely sweet marinated and had no particularly Thai spice flavors.

I would have enjoyed it more, though, if this store were organized better. It was nothing but an exercise in frustration going through the fiction section. I am not sure if it was a matter of the store being in transition, or what was going on, but the ""General Non Fiction"" shelves included a number of books that should have been filed in the fantasy or science fiction shelves, which were incredibly tiny as it was. It make finding anything incredibly difficult, as it was hard to tell if they just didn't carry a particular author, or if it was mistakenly shelved elsewhere.

Service was perfectly polite, the Starbucks inside is pretty comfortable and a good place to relax. However, if a bookstore wants to compete with Amazon, they really need to have their stuff together and not annoy the customer.",2015/5/26 15:21,2015
vQMcpsCYhkpJKvkity2VHA,2,"I passed Five Guys, In-N-Out, Carl's Jr, and Sonic to get to The Habit.  It won't happen again. I don't know where all these five stars are coming... but their burger tasted like an unseasoned Sonic burger... and more overpriced than Five Guys. I WILL SAY THAT THE CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS GREAT!",2018/2/1 21:01,2018
LiE33AU9CAZooCyAXr957w,5,"Some cretin at a store swiped my credit card information while ringing me up and then charged 3,000 bucks worth of stuff on my Keybank debit card.  I was in Florida at the time on a long term assignment, hundreds of miles from a Keybank.  I discovered the fraudulent charges when I checked my balance just before leaving on a road trip.  I called the customer service number and within a few hours all my money was back in my account.  They canceled my number and sent me an all new card by FedEx which arrived the next day at my destination. They made the whole recovery process so easy.  Miss this bank, big time.",2005/5/11 5:05,2005

lmxA0dJM0XsPCIHPXhEQ-g,2,"I just want to note that I am all about eating quality sushi. I have been to many sushi places  and I know when the sushi is worth the money. Unfortunately, this is not one of them.  The presentation of the sushi is clean and organized but the quality of taste was not there. 

We ordered the Godzilla and  10 orders of sake nigiri and 10 order of shrimp nigiri. I was disappointed. It was not fresh enough for my taste and not good enough for the money I spent there. The fresh sushi was flavorless and the rolls did not have a correct balance of flavor. 

If you guys are big sushi fans and know the difference between great sushi, good sushi and poor sushi, then this is place in not for you. But if you do like spending $5 on one piece of Nigiri/sashimi (not even a set of two) cause you won big in the casino or something, then be my guest.",2016/6/11 21:17,2016

CIdyd88FK-4-YaEFo3Ht6A,4,"The whole experience is awesome. They start you off with silly anouncements from the gate. In other words, the staff is friendly, spontaneous, and well, AWESOME. It's a small plane, though, so whether you're travelling a short (ie from San Francisco to Vegas) or longer distance (SF to New York), then Virgin America is the way to go.  

I guess the airline is famous for its mood lighting which is relaxing. They have a really cool in-flight entertainment system - touch-screen, on-demand movies, live satellite TV, radio, etc. So if you're flying, better bring your own headset coz they sell theirs for $2. To sum it up, the experience was so darn good that I wish I had more time on the plane.",2010/1/8 9:36,2010
zRJBKJkEheN30Vl_fdiS7g,2,"The reviews for this place on Facebook are great so despite not having a presence on Yelp, I made an appointment.  I won't deny my dog needed some serious grooming.  We'd brushed him out the night before but he could still use more combing, his hind legs/butt trimmed up and he had some matts behind his ear.  There are 4 doors at this place, I believe. If you just pull in to the drive way it's not terribly clear until you get closer to the doors and see signs directing you which to go into.  The lobby is cute. I was quickly greeted and I was given a form to complete. The woman doing the grooming introduced herself and I asked that his hind legs and butt get trimmed up and asked that she cut out any matts.  She said it would probably take about 3 hours.  I received a text about 3 1/2 hours later stating the price would be $80 and if I returned within 8 weeks it would be $65.  I went to pick him up and I was shocked that they shaved him.  His hair was NOT that bad.  Not to mention the hair that was left was not soft as it has been after visiting other groomers.  I didn't say anything because I was so shocked in the moment so I took him home.  We saw our dog paying particular attention to his private area...more so than he usually does.  My husband looked closer and found that he had been nicked a couple of times.  We found a large cut behind one of his ears.  We won't be returning.",2016/3/7 0:34,2016
