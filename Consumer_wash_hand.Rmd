This is an R Markdown document that shows the process of cleaning two data sets of consumer behavior on food. 

You can find the raw data sets on the below link:

* [Consumers who wash hands and surfaces often during food preparation](https://github.com/yunzhinikkikong/ANLY-501-portfolio/blob/FS/FS-5.1-data.csv)

* [Consumers who refrigerate foods promptly](https://github.com/yunzhinikkikong/ANLY-501-portfolio/blob/FS/FS5.4.csv)

### Part one: Consumers who wash hands and surfaces often during food preparation

```{r message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
# read the CSV file into R
Consumer_preparation<-read.csv("FS-5.1-data.csv",header = TRUE)
# Delete all the footnote information in the initial file
Consumer_preparation<-Consumer_preparation[1:30,]
# remove Geography information,since they are all the same
Consumer_preparation<-Consumer_preparation[,-2]
# I will only keep the estimates and drop the standard error and CI column
Consumer_preparation<-Consumer_preparation[-1,-c(3,4,5,7,8,9,11,12,13)]
names(Consumer_preparation)<-c("category","2006","2009-2010","2015-2016")
write.csv(Consumer_preparation,"Consumer_preparation.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

### Part two: Consumers who refrigerate foods promptly

```{r message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
# read the CSV file into R
Consumer_refrigerate<-read.csv("FS5.4.csv",header = TRUE)
# Delete all the footnote information in the initial file
Consumer_refrigerate<-Consumer_refrigerate[1:30,]
# remove Geography information,since they are all the same
Consumer_refrigerate<-Consumer_refrigerate[,-2]
# I will only keep the estimates and drop the standard error and CI column
Consumer_refrigerate<-Consumer_refrigerate[-1,-c(3,4,5,7,8,9,11,12,13)]
names(Consumer_refrigerate)<-c("category","2006","2009-2010","2015-2016")
write.csv(Consumer_refrigerate,"Consumer_refrigerate.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```
