This is an R Markdown document that shows the process of cleaning the U.S. consumption of plant nutrients data. 
You can find the raw data set on the below link:

* [U.S. consumption of plant nutrients data](https://github.com/yunzhinikkikong/ANLY-501-portfolio/blob/master/U.S.%20consumption%20of%20plant%20nutrients.csv)


```{r message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
nutrient<-read.csv("U.S. consumption of plant nutrients.csv",skip = 3)
# remove empty columns
nutrient<-nutrient[,-c(2,7,11,12,13,14)]
# The note on the first three rows lets us know that the data set contains duplicate information.
# It includes both percentage and count, I will drop the percentage.
nutrient<-nutrient[-c(1,2,3),-c(6,7,8)]
# drop the footnote
nutrient<-nutrient[1:52,]
names(nutrient)<-c("year","Nitrogen","Phosphate","Potash","Total")

#### convert all columns into numeric 
nutrient$Nitrogen=gsub(",","",nutrient$Nitrogen)
nutrient$Nitrogen=as.numeric(nutrient$Nitrogen)
nutrient$Phosphate=gsub(",","",nutrient$Phosphate)
nutrient$Phosphate=as.numeric(nutrient$Phosphate)
nutrient$Potash=gsub(",","",nutrient$Potash)
nutrient$Potash=as.numeric(nutrient$Potash)

# the total value column give wrong sum, many are less or more than 1 actual value, I will re-calculate the total
nutrient<-nutrient%>%
   mutate(Total = rowSums(.[2:4]))
write.csv(nutrient,"nutrient_clean.csv", row.names = FALSE)
# Check the density plot of the total value
nutrient%>%ggplot( aes(x=Total)) + 
  geom_density(color="darkblue", fill="lightblue")+
  ggtitle("Density Plot of Total Value")
```
